Databricks takes the following steps to notify customers about a model that is set for retirement:\n\nA warning message displays in the model card from the Serving page of your Databricks workspace that indicates that the model is planned for retirement.\n\nA warning message displays in the dropdown menu for Foundation Model Fine-tuning in the Experiments tab that indicates that the model is planned for retirement.\n\nThe applicable documentation contains a notice that indicates the model is planned for retirement and the start date it will no longer be supported.\n\nAfter users are notified about the upcoming model retirement, Databricks will retire the model in three months. During this three-month period, customers can either:\n\nChoose to migrate to a provisioned throughput endpoint to continue using the model past its end-of-life date\n\nMigrate existing workflows to use recommended replacement models.\n\nOn the retirement date, the model is removed from the product, and applicable documentation is updated to recommend using a replacement model.\n\nSee Retired models for a list of currently retired models and planned retirement dates.\n\nModel updates\n\nDatabricks might ship incremental updates to pay-per-token models to deliver optimizations. When a model is updated, the endpoint URL remains the same, but the model ID in the response object changes to reflect the date of the update. For example, if an update is shipped to meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-405B on 3/4/2024, the model name in the response object updates to meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-405B-030424. Databricks maintains a version history of the updates that you can refer to.\n\nRetired models\n\nThe following sections summarize current and upcoming model retirements for the Foundation Model APIs pay-per-token and Foundation Model Fine-tuning offerings.\n\nFoundation Model Fine-tuning retirements\n\nThe following table shows retired model families, their retirement dates, and recommended replacement model families to use for Foundation Model Fine-tuning workloads. Databricks recommends that you migrate your applications to use replacement models before the indicated retirement date.\n\nModel family\n\n\t\n\nRetirement date\n\n\t\n\nRecommended replacement model family\n\n\n\n\nMeta-Llama-3\n\n\t\n\nJanuary 7, 2025\n\n\t\n\nMeta-Llama-3.1\n\n\n\n\nMeta-Llama-2\n\n\t\n\nJanuary 7, 2025\n\n\t\n\nMeta-Llama-3.1\n\n\n\n\nCode Llama\n\n\t\n\nJanuary 7, 2025\n\n\t\n\nMeta-Llama-3.1\n\nFoundation Model APIs pay-per-token retirements\n\nThe following table shows model retirements, their retirement dates, and recommended replacement models to use for Foundation Model APIs pay-per-token serving workloads. Databricks recommends that you migrate your applications to use replacement models before the indicated retirement date.\n\nImportant\n\nOn December 11, 2024, Meta-Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct replaced support for Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct in Foundation Model APIs pay-per-token endpoints.\n\nModel\n\n\t\n\nRetirement date\n\n\t\n\nRecommended replacement model\n\n\n\n\nMeta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct\n\n\t\n\nDecember 11, 2024\n\n\t\n\nMeta-Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct\n\n\n\n\nMeta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct\n\n\t\n\nJuly 23, 2024\n\n\t\n\nMeta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct\n\n\n\n\nMeta-Llama-2-70B-Chat\n\n\t\n\nOctober 30, 2024\n\n\t\n\nMeta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct\n\n\n\n\nMPT 7B Instruct\n\n\t\n\nAugust 30, 2024\n\n\t\n\nMixtral-8x7B\n\n\n\n\nMPT 30B Instruct\n\n\t\n\nAugust 30, 2024\n\n\t\n\nMixtral-8x7B\n\nIf you require long-term support for a specific model version, Databricks recommends using Foundation Model APIs provisioned throughput for your serving workloads.\n\n© Databricks 2025.
