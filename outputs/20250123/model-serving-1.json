Unstructured retrievers enable agents to query unstructured data sources, such as a document corpus, using vector search indexes.\n\nTo learn more about agent tools, see Create AI agent tools.\n\nVector Search retriever tool with Unity Catalog functions\n\nThe following example creates a Unity Catalog function for a retriever tool that can query data from a Mosaic AI Vector Search index.\n\nThe Unity Catalog function databricks_docs_vector_search queries a hypothetical Vector Search index containing Databricks documentation. It wraps the Databricks SQL function vector_search() and uses the aliases page_content and metadata to match its output to the MLflow retriever schema.\n\nNote\n\nTo conform to the MLflow retriever schema, any additional metadata columns must be added to the metadata column using the SQL map function, rather than as top-level output keys.\n\nRun the following code in a notebook or SQL editor.\n\nCopy\nSQL\nCREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION main.default.databricks_docs_vector_search (\n  -- The agent uses this comment to determine how to generate the query string parameter.\n  query STRING\n  COMMENT 'The query string for searching Databricks documentation.'\n) RETURNS TABLE\n-- The agent uses this comment to determine when to call this tool. It describes the types of documents and information contained within the index.\nCOMMENT 'Executes a search on Databricks documentation to retrieve text documents most relevant to the input query.' RETURN\nSELECT\n  chunked_text as page_content,\n  map('doc_uri', url, 'chunk_id', chunk_id) as metadata\nFROM\n  vector_search(\n    -- Specify your Vector Search index name here\n    index => 'catalog.schema.databricks_docs_index',\n    query => query,\n    num_results => 5\n  )\n\n\nThis retriever tool has the following caveats:\n\nMLflow traces this Unity Catalog function as a TOOL span type rather than a RETRIEVER span type. As a result, downstream Agent Framework applications like the agent review app and AI Playground will not show retriever-specific details such as links to chunks. For more information on span types, see MLflow Tracing Schema.\n\nSQL clients may limit the maximum number of rows or bytes returned. To prevent data truncation, you should truncate column values returned by the UDF. For example, you could use substring(chunked_text, 0, 8192) to reduce the size of large content columns and avoid row truncation during execution.\n\nSince this tool is a wrapper for the vector_search() function, it is subject to the same limitations as the vector_search() function. See Limitations.\n\nIf this example is unsuitable for your use case, create a vector search retriever tool using custom agent code instead.\n\nVector Search retriever with agent code (PyFunc)\n\nThe following example creates a Vector Search retriever for a PyFunc-flavored agent in agent code.\n\nThis example uses databricks-vectorsearch to create a basic retriever that performs a Vector Search similarity search with filters. It uses MLflow decorators to enable agent tracing.\n\nNote\n\nTo conform to the MLflow retriever schema, the retriever function should return a Document type and use the metadata field in the Document class to add additional attributes to the returned document, like like doc_uri and similarity_score.\n\nUse the following code in the agent module or agent notebook.\n\nCopy\nPython\nimport mlflow\nimport json\n\nfrom mlflow.entities import Document\nfrom typing import List, Dict, Any\nfrom dataclasses import asdict\nfrom databricks.vector_search.client import VectorSearchClient\n\nclass VectorSearchRetriever:\n    \"\"\"\n    Class using Databricks Vector Search to retrieve relevant documents.\n    \"\"\"\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.vector_search_client = VectorSearchClient(disable_notice=True)\n        # TODO: Replace this with the list of column names to return in the result when querying Vector Search\n        self.columns = [\"chunk_id\", \"text_column\", \"doc_uri\"]\n        self.vector_search_index = self.vector_search_client.get_index(\n            index_name=\"catalog.schema.chunked_docs_index\"\n        )\n        mlflow.models.set_retriever_schema(\n            name=\"vector_search\",\n            primary_key=\"chunk_id\",\n            text_column=\"text_column\",\n            doc_uri=\"doc_uri\"\n        )\n\n    @mlflow.trace(span_type=\"RETRIEVER\", name=\"vector_search\")\n    def __call__(\n        self,\n        query: str,\n        filters: Dict[Any, Any] = None,\n        score_threshold = None\n    ) -> List[Document]:\n        \"\"\"\n        Performs vector search to retrieve relevant chunks.\n        Args:\n            query: Search query.\n            filters: Optional filters to apply to the search.

You can optionally include Vector Search filters in the request to filter results.\n\nCopy\nPython\nretriever = VectorSearchRetriever()\nquery = \"What is Databricks?\"\nfilters={\"text_column LIKE\": \"Databricks\"},\nresults = retriever(query, filters=filters, score_threshold=0.1)\n\nSet retriever schema\n\nTo ensure that retrievers are traced properly and render correctly in downstream applications, call mlflow.models.set_retriever_schema when you define your agent. Use set_retriever_schema to map the column names in the returned table to MLflow’s expected fields such as primary_key, text_column, and doc_uri.\n\nCopy\nPython\n# Define the retriever's schema by providing your column names\nmlflow.models.set_retriever_schema(\n    name=\"vector_search\",\n    primary_key=\"chunk_id\",\n    text_column=\"text_column\",\n    doc_uri=\"doc_uri\"\n    # other_columns=[\"column1\", \"column2\"],\n)\n\n\nYou can also specify additional columns in your retriever’s schema by providing a list of column names with the other_columns field.\n\nIf you have multiple retrievers, you can define multiple schemas by using unique names for each retriever schema.\n\nThe retriever schema set during agent creation affects downstream applications and workflows, such as the review app and evaluation sets. Specifically, the doc_uri column serves as the primary identifier for documents returned by the retriever.\n\nThe review app displays the doc_uri to help reviewers assess responses and trace document origins. See Review App UI.\n\nEvaluation sets use doc_uri to compare retriever results against predefined evaluation datasets to determine the retriever’s recall and precision. See Evaluation sets.\n\nTrace the retriever\n\nMLflow tracing adds observability by capturing detailed information about your agent’s execution. It provides a way to record the inputs, outputs, and metadata associated with each intermediate step of a request, enabling you to pinpoint the source of bugs and unexpected behaviors quickly.\n\nThis example uses the @mlflow.trace decorator to create a trace for the retriever and parser. For other options for setting up trace methods, see MLflow Tracing for agents.\n\nThe decorator creates a span that starts when the function is invoked and ends when it returns. MLflow automatically records the function’s input and output and any exceptions raised.\n\nNote\n\nLangChain, LlamaIndex, and OpenAI library users can use MLflow auto logging instead of manually defining traces with the decorator. See Use autologging to add traces to your agents.\n\nCopy\nPython\n...\n@mlflow.trace(span_type=\"RETRIEVER\", name=\"vector_search\")\ndef __call__(self, query: str) -> List[Document]:\n  ...\n\n\nTo ensure downstream applications such as Agent Evaluation and the AI Playground render the retriever trace correctly, make sure the decorator meets the following requirements:\n\nUse span_type=\"RETRIEVER\" and ensure the function returns List[Document] object. See Retriever spans.\n\nThe trace name and the retriever_schema name must match to configure the trace correctly.\n\nFilter Vector Search results\n\nYou can limit the search scope to a subset of data using a Vector Search filter.\n\nThe filters parameter in VectorSearchRetriever defines the filter conditions using the Databricks Vector Search filter specification.\n\nCopy\nPython\nfilters = {\"text_column LIKE\": \"Databricks\"}\n\n\nInside the __call__ method, the filters dictionary is passed directly to the similarity_search function:\n\nCopy\nPython\nresults = self.vector_search_index.similarity_search(\n    query_text=query,\n    columns=self.columns,\n    filters=filters,\n    num_results=5,\n    query_type=\"ann\"\n)\n\n\nAfter initial filtering, the score_threshold parameter provides additional filtering by setting a minimum similarity score.\n\nCopy\nPython\nif score >= score_threshold:\n    metadata[\"similarity_score\"] = score\n\n\nThe final result includes documents that meet the filters and score_threshold conditions.\n\nNext steps\n\nAfter you create a Unity Catalog function agent tool, add the tool to an AI agent.

The Unity Catalog function system.ai.python_exec is available by default and can be used like any other Unity Catalog function-based tool.\n\nPython executor tool\n\nThe following example re-creates the built-in tool, system.ai.python_exec that allows an agent to execute Python code.\n\nRun the following code in a notebook cell. It uses the %sql notebook magic to create a Unity Catalog function called python_exec.\n\nCopy\nSQL\n%sql\nCREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION main.default.python_exec (\n        code STRING COMMENT \"Python code to execute.

Structured outputs is OpenAI-compatible and is only available during model serving as part of Foundation Model APIs.\n\nWhat are structured outputs?\n\nStructured outputs provide a way to generate structured data in the form of JSON objects from your input data. You can choose to generate text, unstructured JSON objects, and JSON objects that adhere to a specific JSON schema. Structured outputs are supported for chat models served using Foundation Model APIs pay-per-token and provisioned throughput endpoints.\n\nDatabricks recommends using structured outputs for the following scenarios:\n\nExtracting data from large amounts of documents. For example, identifying and classifying product review feedback as negative, positive or neutral.\n\nBatch inference tasks that require outputs to be in a specified format.\n\nData processing, like turning unstructured data into structured data.\n\nUse structured outputs\n\nSpecify your structured outputs using response_format in your chat request. See Foundation model REST API reference.\n\nThe following is an example of data extraction of research papers to a specific JSON schema.\n\nCopy\nPython\nimport os\nimport json\nfrom openai import OpenAI\n\nDATABRICKS_TOKEN = os.environ.get('YOUR_DATABRICKS_TOKEN')\nDATABRICKS_BASE_URL = os.environ.get('YOUR_DATABRICKS_BASE_URL')\n\nclient = OpenAI(\n  api_key=DATABRICKS_TOKEN,\n  base_url=DATABRICKS_BASE_URL\n  )\n\nresponse_format = {\n      \"type\": \"json_schema\",\n      \"json_schema\": {\n        \"name\": \"research_paper_extraction\",\n        \"schema\": {\n          \"type\": \"object\",\n          \"properties\": {\n            \"title\": { \"type\": \"string\" },\n            \"authors\": {\n              \"type\": \"array\",\n              \"items\": { \"type\": \"string\" }\n            },\n            \"abstract\": { \"type\": \"string\" },\n            \"keywords\": {\n              \"type\": \"array\",\n              \"items\": { \"type\": \"string\" }\n            }\n          },\n        },\n        \"strict\": True\n      }\n    }\n\nmessages = [{\n        \"role\": \"system\",\n        \"content\": \"You are an expert at structured data extraction. You will be given unstructured text from a research paper and should convert it into the given structure.\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"role\": \"user\",\n        \"content\": \"...\"\n      }]\n\nresponse = client.chat.completions.create(\n    model=\"databricks-meta-llama-3-1-70b-instruct\",\n    messages=messages,\n    response_format=response_format\n)\n\nprint(json.dumps(response.choices[0].message.model_dump()['content'], indent=2))\n\n\nThe following is an example of JSON extraction, but the JSON schema is not known before hand.\n\nCopy\nPython\nimport os\nimport json\nfrom openai import OpenAI\n\nDATABRICKS_TOKEN = os.environ.get('YOUR_DATABRICKS_TOKEN')\nDATABRICKS_BASE_URL = os.environ.get('YOUR_DATABRICKS_BASE_URL')\n\nclient = OpenAI(\n  api_key=DATABRICKS_TOKEN,\n  base_url=DATABRICKS_BASE_URL\n  )\n\nresponse_format = {\n      \"type\": \"json_object\",\n    }\n\nmessages = [\n      {\n        \"role\": \"user\",\n        \"content\": \"Extract the name, size, price, and color from this product description as a JSON object:\\n<description>\\nThe SmartHome Mini is a compact smart home assistant available in black or white for only $49.99. It's 5 inches wide.\\n</description>\"\n      }]\n\nresponse = client.chat.completions.create(\n    model=\"databricks-meta-llama-3-1-70b-instruct\",\n    messages=messages,\n    response_format=response_format\n)\n\nprint(json.dumps(response.choices[0].message.model_dump()['content'], indent=2))\n\nJSON schema\n\nFoundation Model APIs broadly support structured outputs accepted by OpenAI. However, using a simpler JSON schema for JSON schema definitions results in higher quality JSON generation. To promote higher quality generation, Foundation Model APIs only support a subset of JSON schema specifications.\n\nThe following function call definition keys are not supported:\n\nRegular expressions using pattern.\n\nComplex nested or schema composition and validation using: anyOf, oneOf, allOf, prefixItems, or $ref.\n\nLists of types except for the special case of [type, “null”] where one type in the list is a valid JSON type and the other is \"null\"\n\nToken usage\n\nPrompt injection and other techniques are used to enhance the quality of structured outputs. Doing so impacts the number of input and output tokens consumed by the model, which in turn results in billing implications.\n\nLimitations\n\nThe maximum number of keys specified in the JSON schema is 64.\n\nFoundation Model APIs does not enforce length or size constraints for objects and arrays.\n\nThis includes keywords like maxProperties, minProperties, and maxLength.\n\nHeavily nested JSON schemas result in lower quality generation. If possible, try flattening the JSON schema for better results.\n\nWas this article helpful?\n\n© Databricks 2025. All rights reserved.

For external models or provisioned throughput workloads, use AI Gateway-enabled inference tables.\n\nThis article explains how to use the Databricks API to enable inference tables for a model serving endpoint. For general information about using inference tables, including how to enable them using the Databricks UI, see Inference tables for monitoring and debugging models.\n\nYou can enable inference tables when you create a new endpoint or on an existing endpoint. Databricks recommends that you create the endpoint with a service principal so that the inference table is not affected if the user who created the endpoint is removed from the workspace.\n\nThe owner of the inference tables is the user who created the endpoint. All access control lists (ACLs) on the table follow the standard Unity Catalog permissions and can be modified by the table owner.\n\nRequirements\n\nYour workspace must have Unity Catalog enabled.\n\nBoth the creator of the endpoint and the modifier must have Can Manage permission on the endpoint. See Access control lists.\n\nBoth the creator of the endpoint and the modifier must have the following permissions in Unity Catalog:\n\nUSE CATALOG permissions on the specified catalog.\n\nUSE SCHEMA permissions on the specified schema.\n\nCREATE TABLE permissions in the schema.\n\nEnable inference tables at endpoint creation using the API\n\nYou can enable inference tables for an endpoint during endpoint creation using the API. For instructions on creating an endpoint, see Create custom model serving endpoints.\n\nIn the API, the request body has an auto_capture_config to specify:\n\nThe Unity Catalog catalog: string representing the catalog to store the table\n\nThe Unity Catalog schema: string representing the schema to store the table\n\n(optional) table prefix: string used as a prefix for the inference table name. If this isn’t specified, the endpoint name is used.\n\n(optional) enabled: boolean value used to enable or disable inference tables. This true by default.\n\nAfter specifying a catalog, schema, and optionally table prefix, a table is created at <catalog>.<schema>.<table_prefix>_payload. This table automatically creates a Unity Catalog managed table. The owner of the table is the user who creates the endpoint.\n\nNote\n\nSpecifying an existing table is not supported since the inference table is always automatically created on endpoint creation or endpoint updates.\n\nWarning\n\nThe inference table could become corrupted if you do any of the following:\n\nChange the table schema.\n\nChange the table name.\n\nDelete the table.\n\nLose permissions to the Unity Catalog catalog or schema.\n\nIn this case, the auto_capture_config of the endpoint status shows a FAILED state for the payload table. If this happens, you must create a new endpoint to continue using inference tables.\n\nThe following example demonstrates how to enable inference tables during endpoint creation.\n\nCopy\nBash\nPOST /api/2.0/serving-endpoints\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"feed-ads\",\n  \"config\":\n  {\n    \"served_entities\": [\n      {\n       \"entity_name\": \"ads1\",\n       \"entity_version\": \"1\",\n       \"workload_size\": \"Small\",\n       \"scale_to_zero_enabled\": true\n      }\n    ],\n    \"auto_capture_config\":\n    {\n       \"catalog_name\": \"ml\",\n       \"schema_name\": \"ads\",\n       \"table_name_prefix\": \"feed-ads-prod\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\nThe response looks like:\n\nCopy\nJSON\n{\n  \"name\": \"feed-ads\",\n  \"creator\": \"customer@example.com\",\n  \"creation_timestamp\": 1666829055000,\n  \"last_updated_timestamp\": 1666829055000,\n  \"state\": {\n    \"ready\": \"NOT_READY\",\n    \"config_update\": \"IN_PROGRESS\"\n  },\n  \"pending_config\": {\n    \"start_time\": 1666718879000,\n    \"served_entities\": [\n      {\n        \"name\": \"ads1-1\",\n        \"entity_name\": \"ads1\",\n        \"entity_version\": \"1\",\n        \"workload_size\": \"Small\",\n        \"scale_to_zero_enabled\": true,\n        \"state\": {\n          \"deployment\": \"DEPLOYMENT_CREATING\",\n          \"deployment_state_message\": \"Creating\"\n        },\n        \"creator\": \"customer@example.com\",\n        \"creation_timestamp\": 1666829055000\n    }\n   ],\n   \"config_version\": 1,\n   \"traffic_config\": {\n     \"routes\": [\n       {\n         \"served_model_name\": \"ads1-1\",\n         \"traffic_percentage\": 100\n       }\n      ]\n   },\n   \"auto_capture_config\": {\n     \"catalog_name\": \"ml\",\n     \"schema_name\": \"ads\",\n     \"table_name_prefix\": \"feed-ads-prod\",\n     \"state\": {\n       \"payload_table\": {\n         \"name\": \"feed-ads-prod_payload\"\n       }\n     },\n     \"enabled\": true\n   }\n  },\n  \"id\": \"xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\",\n  \"permission_level\": \"CAN_MANAGE\"\n}\n\n\nOnce logging to inference tables has been enabled, wait until your endpoint is ready. Then you can start calling it.\n\nAfter you create an inference table, schema evolution and adding data should be handled by the system.\n\nThe following operations do not impact the integrity of the table:\n\nRunning OPTIMIZE, ANALYZE, and VACUUM against the table.\n\nDeleting old unused data.\n\nIf you don’t specify an auto_capture_config, by default the settings configuration from the previous configuration version is re-used. For example, if inference tables was already enabled, the same settings are used on the next endpoint update or if inference tables was disabled, then it continues being disabled.\n\nCopy\nJSON\n{\n  \"served_entities\": [\n    {\n      \"name\":\"current\",\n      \"entity_name\":\"model-A\",\n      \"entity_version\":\"1\",\n      \"workload_size\":\"Small\",\n      \"scale_to_zero_enabled\":true\n    }\n  ],\n  \"auto_capture_config\": {\n    \"enabled\": false\n  }\n}\n\nEnable inference tables on an existing endpoint using the API\n\nYou can also enable inference tables on an existing endpoint using the API. After inference tables are enabled, continue specifying the same auto_capture_config body in future update endpoint API calls to continue using inference tables.\n\nNote\n\nChanging the table location after enabling inference tables is not supported.\n\nCopy\nBash\nPUT /api/2.0/serving-endpoints/{name}/config\n\n{\n  \"served_entities\": [\n    {\n      \"name\":\"current\",\n      \"entity_name\":\"model-A\",\n      \"entity_version\":\"1\",\n      \"workload_size\":\"Small\",\n      \"scale_to_zero_enabled\":true\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\":\"challenger\",\n      \"entity_name\":\"model-B\",\n      \"entity_version\":\"1\",\n      \"workload_size\":\"Small\",\n      \"scale_to_zero_enabled\":true\n    }\n  ],\n  \"traffic_config\":{\n    \"routes\": [\n      {\n        \"served_model_name\":\"current\",\n        \"traffic_percentage\":\"50\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"served_model_name\":\"challenger\",\n        \"traffic_percentage\":\"50\"\n      }\n    ]\n  },\n  \"auto_capture_config\":{\n   \"catalog_name\": \"catalog\",\n   \"schema_name\": \"schema\",\n   \"table_name_prefix\": \"my-endpoint\"\n  }\n}\n\nDisable inference tables\n\nWhen disabling inference tables, you do not need to specify catalog, schema, or table prefix.

You can validate this by checking the endpoint health with the following:\n\nCopy\nBash\ncurl -n -X GET -H \"Authorization: Bearer [PAT]\" https://[DATABRICKS_HOST]/api/2.0/serving-endpoints/[ENDPOINT_NAME]\n\n\nValidate the export metrics API:\n\nCopy\nBash\ncurl -n -X GET -H \"Authorization: Bearer [PAT]\" https://[DATABRICKS_HOST]/api/2.0/serving-endpoints/[ENDPOINT_NAME]/metrics\n\nServing endpoint metrics definitions\n\nMetric\n\n\t\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nLatency (ms)\n\n\t\n\nCaptures the median (P50) and 99th percentile (P99) round-trip latency times within Databricks. This does not include additional Databricks-related latencies like authentication and rate limiting\n\n\n\n\nRequest rate (per second)\n\n\t\n\nMeasures the number of requests processed per second. This rate is calculated by totaling the number of requests within a minute and then dividing by 60 (the number of seconds in a minute).\n\n\n\n\nRequest error rate (per second)\n\n\t\n\nTracks the rate of 4xx and 5xx HTTP error responses per second. Similar to the request rate, it’s computed by aggregating the total number of unsuccessful requests within a minute and dividing by 60.\n\n\n\n\nCPU usage (%)\n\n\t\n\nShows the average CPU utilization percentage across all server replicas. In the context of Databricks infrastructure, a replica refers to virtual machine nodes. Depending on your configured concurrency settings, Databricks creates multiple replicas to manage model traffic efficiently.\n\n\n\n\nMemory usage (%)\n\n\t\n\nShows the average memory utilization percentage across all server replicas.\n\n\n\n\nProvisioned concurrency\n\n\t\n\nProvisioned concurrency is the maximum number of parallel requests that the system can handle. Provisioned concurrency dynamically adjusts within the minimum and maximum limits of the compute scale-out range, varying in response to incoming traffic.\n\n\n\n\nGPU usage (%)\n\n\t\n\nRepresents the average GPU utilization, as reported by the NVIDIA DCGM exporter. If the instance type has multiple GPUs, each is tracked separately (such as, gpu0, gpu1, …, gpuN). The utilization is averaged across all server replicas and sampled once a minute. Note: The infrequent sampling means this metric is most accurate under a constant load.\n\nView this metric from the Serving UI on the Metrics tab of your serving endpoint.\n\n\n\n\nGPU memory usage (%)\n\n\t\n\nIndicates the average percentage of utilized frame buffer memory on each GPU based on NVIDIA DCGM exporter data. As with GPU usage, this metric is averaged across replicas and sampled every minute. It is most reliable under consistent load conditions.\n\nView this metric from the Serving UI on the Metrics tab of your serving endpoint.\n\nPrometheus integration\n\nNote\n\nRegardless of which type of deployment you have in your production environment, the scraping configuration should be similar.\n\nThe guidance in this section follows the Prometheus documentation to start a Prometheus service locally using docker.\n\nWrite a yaml config file and name it prometheus.yml. The following is an example:\n\nCopy\nYAML\n global:\n  scrape_interval: 1m\n  scrape_timeout: 10s\n scrape_configs:\n  - job_name: \"prometheus\"\n    metrics_path: \"/api/2.0/serving-endpoints/[ENDPOINT_NAME]/metrics\"\n    scheme: \"https\"\n    authorization:\n     type: \"Bearer\"\n     credentials: \"[PAT_TOKEN]\"\n\n    static_configs:\n     - targets: [\"dbc-741cfa95-12d1.dev.databricks.com\"]\n\n\nStart Prometheus locally with the following command:\n\nCopy\nBash\n   docker run \\\n   -p 9090:9090 \\\n   -v /path/to/prometheus.yml:/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml \\\n   prom/prometheus\n\n\nNavigate to http://localhost:9090 to check if your local Prometheus service is up and running.\n\nCheck the Prometheus scraper status and debug errors from: http://localhost:9090/targets?search=\n\nOnce the target is fully up and running, you can query the provided metrics, like cpu_usage_percentage or mem_usage_percentage, in the UI.\n\nDatadog integration\n\nNote\n\nThe preliminary set up for this example is based on the free edition.\n\nDatadog has a variety of agents that can be deployed in different environments. For demonstration purposes, the following launches a Mac OS agent locally that scrapes the metrics endpoint in your Databricks host. The configuration for using other agents should be in a similar pattern.\n\nRegister a datadog account.\n\nInstall OpenMetrics integration in your account dashboard, so Datadog can accept and process OpenMetrics data.\n\nFollow the Datadog documentation to get your Datadog agent up and running. For this example, use the DMG package option to have everything installed including launchctl and datadog-agent.\n\nLocate your OpenMetrics configuration. For this example, the configuration is at ~/.datadog-agent/conf.d/openmetrics.d/conf.yaml.default. The following is an example configuration yaml file.\n\nCopy\nYAML\n instances:\n  - openmetrics_endpoint: https://[DATABRICKS_HOST]/api/2.0/serving-endpoints/[ENDPOINT_NAME]/metrics\n\n   metrics:\n   - cpu_usage_percentage:\n       name: cpu_usage_percentage\n       type: gauge\n   - mem_usage_percentage:\n       name: mem_usage_percentage\n       type: gauge\n   - provisioned_concurrent_requests_total:\n       name: provisioned_concurrent_requests_total\n       type: gauge\n   - request_4xx_count_total:\n       name: request_4xx_count_total\n       type: gauge\n   - request_5xx_count_total:\n       name: request_5xx_count_total\n       type: gauge\n   - request_count_total:\n       name: request_count_total\n       type: gauge\n   - request_latency_ms:\n       name: request_latency_ms\n       type: histogram\n\n   tag_by_endpoint: false\n\n   send_distribution_buckets: true\n\n   headers:\n     Authorization: Bearer [PAT]\n     Content-Type: application/openmetrics-text\n\n\nStart datadog agent using launchctl start com.datadoghq.agent.\n\nEvery time you need to make changes to your config, you need to restart the agent to pick up the change.\n\nCopy\nBash\n launchctl stop com.datadoghq.agent\n launchctl start com.datadoghq.agent\n\n\nCheck the agent health with datadog-agent health.\n\nCheck agent status with datadog-agent status. You should be able to see a response like the following. If not, debug with the error message. Potential issues may be due to an expired PAT token, or an incorrect URL.\n\nCopy\nBash\n openmetrics (2.2.2)\n -------------------\n   Instance ID: openmetrics: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx [OK]\n   Configuration Source: file:/opt/datadog-agent/etc/conf.d/openmetrics.d/conf.yaml.default\n   Total Runs: 1\n   Metric Samples: Last Run: 2, Total: 2\n   Events: Last Run: 0, Total: 0\n   Service Checks: Last Run: 1, Total: 1\n   Average Execution Time : 274ms\n   Last Execution Date : 2022-09-21 23:00:41 PDT / 2022-09-22 06:00:41 UTC (xxxxxxxx)\n   Last Successful Execution Date : 2022-09-21 23:00:41 PDT / 2022-09-22 06:00:41 UTC (xxxxxxx)\n\n\nAgent status can also be seen from the UI at:http://127.0.0.1:5002/.\n\nIf your agent is fully up and running, you can navigate back to your Datadog dashboard to query the metrics. You can also create a monitor or alert based on the metric data:https://app.datadoghq.com/monitors/create/metric.\n\nWas this article helpful?\n\n© Databricks 2025. All rights reserved.

For instructions, see Connect to serverless compute.\n\nSource table must have Change Data Feed enabled. For instructions, see Use Delta Lake change data feed on Databricks.\n\nTo create a vector search index, you must have CREATE TABLE privileges on the catalog schema where the index will be created.\n\nTo query an index that is owned by another user, you must have additional privileges. See Query a vector search endpoint.\n\nPermission to create and manage vector search endpoints is configured using access control lists. See Vector search endpoint ACLs.\n\nInstallation\n\nTo use the vector search SDK, you must install it in your notebook. Use the following code to install the package:\n\nCopy\n%pip install databricks-vectorsearch\ndbutils.library.restartPython()\n\n\nThen use the following command to import VectorSearchClient:\n\nCopy\nfrom databricks.vector_search.client import VectorSearchClient\n\nAuthentication\n\nSee Data protection and authentication.\n\nCreate a vector search endpoint\n\nYou can create a vector search endpoint using the Databricks UI, Python SDK, or the API.\n\nCreate a vector search endpoint using the UI\n\nFollow these steps to create a vector search endpoint using the UI.\n\nIn the left sidebar, click Compute.\n\nClick the Vector Search tab and click Create.\n\nThe Create endpoint form opens. Enter a name for this endpoint.\n\nClick Confirm.\n\nCreate a vector search endpoint using the Python SDK\n\nThe following example uses the create_endpoint() SDK function to create a vector search endpoint.\n\nCopy\nPython\n# The following line automatically generates a PAT Token for authentication\nclient = VectorSearchClient()\n\n# The following line uses the service principal token for authentication\n# client = VectorSearch(service_principal_client_id=<CLIENT_ID>,service_principal_client_secret=<CLIENT_SECRET>)\n\nclient.create_endpoint(\n    name=\"vector_search_endpoint_name\",\n    endpoint_type=\"STANDARD\"\n)\n\nCreate a vector search endpoint using the REST API\n\nSee the REST API reference documentation: POST /api/2.0/vector-search/endpoints.\n\n(Optional) Create and configure an endpoint to serve the embedding model\n\nIf you choose to have Databricks compute the embeddings, you can use a pre-configured Foundation Model APIs endpoint or create a model serving endpoint to serve the embedding model of your choice. See Pay-per-token Foundation Model APIs or Create foundation model serving endpoints for instructions. For example notebooks, see Notebook examples for calling an embeddings model.\n\nWhen you configure an embedding endpoint, Databricks recommends that you remove the default selection of Scale to zero. Serving endpoints can take a couple of minutes to warm up, and the initial query on an index with a scaled down endpoint might timeout.\n\nNote\n\nThe vector search index initialization might time out if the embedding endpoint isn’t configured appropriately for the dataset. You should only use CPU endpoints for small datasets and tests. For larger datasets, use a GPU endpoint for optimal performance.\n\nCreate a vector search index\n\nYou can create a vector search index using the UI, the Python SDK, or the REST API. The UI is the simplest approach.\n\nThere are two types of indexes:\n\nDelta Sync Index automatically syncs with a source Delta Table, automatically and incrementally updating the index as the underlying data in the Delta Table changes.\n\nDirect Vector Access Index supports direct read and write of vectors and metadata. The user is responsible for updating this table using the REST API or the Python SDK. This type of index cannot be created using the UI. You must use the REST API or the SDK.\n\nCreate index using the UI\n\nIn the left sidebar, click Catalog to open the Catalog Explorer UI.\n\nNavigate to the Delta table you want to use.\n\nClick the Create button at the upper-right, and select Vector search index from the drop-down menu.\n\nUse the selectors in the dialog to configure the index.\n\nName: Name to use for the online table in Unity Catalog. The name requires a three-level namespace, <catalog>.<schema>.<name>. Only alphanumeric characters and underscores are allowed.\n\nPrimary key: Column to use as a primary key.\n\nEndpoint: Select the vector search endpoint that you want to use.\n\nColumns to sync: Select the columns to sync with the vector index. If you leave this field blank, all columns from the source table are synced with the index. The primary key column and embedding source column or embedding vector column are always synced.\n\nEmbedding source: Indicate if you want Databricks to compute embeddings for a text column in the Delta table (Compute embeddings), or if your Delta table contains precomputed embeddings (Use existing embedding column).\n\nIf you selected Compute embeddings, select the column that you want embeddings computed for and the endpoint that is serving the embedding model. Only text columns are supported.\n\nIf you selected Use existing embedding column, select the column that contains the precomputed embeddings and the embedding dimension. The format of the precomputed embedding column should be array[float].\n\nSync computed embeddings: Toggle this setting to save the generated embeddings to a Unity Catalog table. For more information, see Save generated embedding table.\n\nSync mode: Continuous keeps the index in sync with seconds of latency. However, it has a higher cost associated with it since a compute cluster is provisioned to run the continuous sync streaming pipeline. For both Continuous and Triggered, the update is incremental — only data that has changed since the last sync is processed.\n\nWith Triggered sync mode, you use the Python SDK or the REST API to start the sync. See Update a Delta Sync Index.\n\nWhen you have finished configuring the index, click Create.\n\nCreate index using the Python SDK\n\nThe following example creates a Delta Sync Index with embeddings computed by Databricks.\n\nCopy\nPython\nclient = VectorSearchClient()\n\nindex = client.create_delta_sync_index(\n  endpoint_name=\"vector_search_demo_endpoint\",\n  source_table_name=\"vector_search_demo.vector_search.en_wiki\",\n  index_name=\"vector_search_demo.vector_search.en_wiki_index\",\n  pipeline_type=\"TRIGGERED\",\n  primary_key=\"id\",\n  embedding_source_column=\"text\",\n  embedding_model_endpoint_name=\"e5-small-v2\"\n)\n\n\nThe following example creates a Delta Sync Index with self-managed embeddings. This example also shows the use of the optional parameter columns_to_sync to select only a subset of columns to use in the index.\n\nCopy\nPython\nclient = VectorSearchClient()\n\nindex = client.create_delta_sync_index(\n  endpoint_name=\"vector_search_demo_endpoint\",\n  source_table_name=\"vector_search_demo.vector_search.en_wiki\",\n  index_name=\"vector_search_demo.vector_search.en_wiki_index\",\n  pipeline_type=\"TRIGGERED\",\n  primary_key=\"id\",\n  embedding_dimension=1024,\n  embedding_vector_column=\"text_vector\"\n)\n\n\nBy default, all columns from the source table are synced with the index. To sync only a subset of columns, use columns_to_sync. The primary key and embedding columns are always included in the index.\n\nTo sync only the primary key and the embedding column, you must specify them in columns_to_sync as shown:\n\nCopy\nPython\nindex = client.create_delta_sync_index(\n  ...\n  columns_to_sync=[\"id\", \"text_vector\"] # to sync only the primary key and the embedding column\n)\n\n\nTo sync additional columns, specify them as shown. You do not need to include the primary key and the embedding column, as they are always synced.\n\nCopy\nPython\nindex = client.create_delta_sync_index(\n  ...\n  columns_to_sync=[\"revisionId\", \"text\"] # to sync the `revisionId` and `text` columns in addition to the primary key and embedding column.\n)\n\n\nThe following example creates a Direct Vector Access Index.\n\nCopy\nPython\n\nclient = VectorSearchClient()\n\nindex = client.create_direct_access_index(\n  endpoint_name=\"storage_endpoint\",\n  index_name=\"{catalog_name}.{schema_name}.{index_name}\",\n  primary_key=\"id\",\n  embedding_dimension=1024,\n  embedding_vector_column=\"text_vector\",\n  schema={\n    \"id\": \"int\",\n    \"field2\": \"string\",\n    \"field3\": \"float\",\n    \"text_vector\": \"array<float>\"}\n)\n\nCreate index using the REST API\n\nSee the REST API reference documentation: POST /api/2.0/vector-search/indexes.\n\nSave generated embedding table\n\nIf Databricks generates the embeddings, you can save the generated embeddings to a table in Unity Catalog. This table is created in the same schema as the vector index and is linked from the vector index page.\n\nThe name of the table is the name of the vector search index, appended by _writeback_table. The name is not editable.\n\nYou can access and query the table like any other table in Unity Catalog. However, you should not drop or modify the table, as it is not intended to be manually updated. The table is deleted automatically if the index is deleted.\n\nUpdate a vector search index\nUpdate a Delta Sync Index\n\nIndexes created with Continuous sync mode automatically update when the source Delta table changes. If you are using Triggered sync mode, use the Python SDK or the REST API to start the sync.\n\nPython SDK\nREST API\nCopy\nindex.sync()\n\nUpdate a Direct Vector Access Index\n\nYou can use the Python SDK or the REST API to insert, update, or delete data from a Direct Vector Access Index.\n\nPython SDK\nREST API\nCopy\n   index.upsert([{\"id\": 1,\n       \"field2\": \"value2\",\n       \"field3\": 3.0,\n       \"text_vector\": [1.0, 2.0, 3.0]\n       },\n       {\"id\": 2,\n        \"field2\": \"value2\",\n        \"field3\": 3.0,\n        \"text_vector\": [1.1, 2.1, 3.0]\n        }\n        ])\n\nQuery a vector search endpoint\n\nYou can only query the vector search endpoint using the Python SDK, the REST API, or the SQL vector_search() AI function.\n\nNote\n\nIf the user querying the endpoint is not the owner of the vector search index, the user must have the following UC privileges:\n\nUSE CATALOG on the catalog that contains the vector search index.\n\nUSE SCHEMA on the schema that contains the vector search index.\n\nSELECT on the vector search index.\n\nTo perform a hybrid keyword-similarity search, set the parameter query_type to hybrid. The default value is ann (approximate nearest neighbor).\n\nPython SDK\nREST API\nSQL\nCopy\n# Delta Sync Index with embeddings computed by Databricks\nresults = index.similarity_search(\n    query_text=\"Greek myths\",\n    columns=[\"id\", \"text\"],\n    num_results=2\n    )\n\n# Delta Sync Index using hybrid search, with embeddings computed by Databricks\nresults3 = index.similarity_search(\n    query_text=\"Greek myths\",\n    columns=[\"id\", \"text\"],\n    num_results=2,\n    query_type=\"hybrid\"\n    )\n\n# Delta Sync Index with pre-calculated embeddings\nresults2 = index.similarity_search(\n    query_vector=[0.2, 0.33, 0.19, 0.52],\n    columns=[\"id\", \"text\"],\n    num_results=2\n    )\n\nUse filters on queries\n\nA query can define filters based on any column in the Delta table. similarity_search returns only rows that match the specified filters. The following filters are supported:\n\nFilter operator\n\n\t\n\nBehavior\n\n\t\n\nExamples\n\n\n\n\nNOT\n\n\t\n\nNegates the filter. The key must end with “NOT”. For example, “color NOT” with value “red” matches documents where the color is not red.\n\n\t\n\n{\"id NOT\": 2} {“color NOT”: “red”}\n\n\n\n\n<\n\n\t\n\nChecks if the field value is less than the filter value. The key must end with ” <”. For example, “price <” with value 200 matches documents where the price is less than 200.\n\n\t\n\n{\"id <\": 200}\n\n\n\n\n<=\n\n\t\n\nChecks if the field value is less than or equal to the filter value. The key must end with ” <=”. For example, “price <=” with value 200 matches documents where the price is less than or equal to 200.\n\n\t\n\n{\"id <=\": 200}\n\n\n\n\n>\n\n\t\n\nChecks if the field value is greater than the filter value. The key must end with ” >”. For example, “price >” with value 200 matches documents where the price is greater than 200.\n\n\t\n\n{\"id >\": 200}\n\n\n\n\n>=\n\n\t\n\nChecks if the field value is greater than or equal to the filter value. The key must end with ” >=”. For example, “price >=” with value 200 matches documents where the price is greater than or equal to 200.\n\n\t\n\n{\"id >=\": 200}\n\n\n\n\nOR\n\n\t\n\nChecks if the field value matches any of the filter values. The key must contain OR to separate multiple subkeys. For example, color1 OR color2 with value [\"red\", \"blue\"] matches documents where either color1 is red or color2 is blue.\n\n\t\n\n{\"color1 OR color2\": [\"red\", \"blue\"]}\n\n\n\n\nLIKE\n\n\t\n\nMatches partial strings.\n\n\t\n\n{\"column LIKE\": \"hello\"}\n\n\n\n\nNo filter operator specified\n\n\t\n\nFilter checks for an exact match. If multiple values are specified, it matches any of the values.\n\n\t\n\n{\"id\": 200} {\"id\": [200, 300]}\n\nSee the following code examples:\n\nPython SDK\nREST API\nCopy\n# Match rows where `title` exactly matches `Athena` or `Ares`\nresults = index.similarity_search(\n    query_text=\"Greek myths\",\n    columns=[\"id\", \"text\"],\n    filters={\"title\": [\"Ares\", \"Athena\"]},\n    num_results=2\n    )\n\n# Match rows where `title` or `id` exactly matches `Athena` or `Ares`\nresults = index.similarity_search(\n    query_text=\"Greek myths\",\n    columns=[\"id\", \"text\"],\n    filters={\"title OR id\": [\"Ares\", \"Athena\"]},\n    num_results=2\n    )\n\n# Match only rows where `title` is not `Hercules`\nresults = index.similarity_search(\n    query_text=\"Greek myths\",\n    columns=[\"id\", \"text\"],\n    filters={\"title NOT\": \"Hercules\"},\n    num_results=2\n    )\n\nExample notebooks\n\nThe examples in this section demonstrate usage of the vector search Python SDK.\n\nLangChain examples\n\nSee How to use LangChain with Mosaic AI Vector Search for using Mosaic AI Vector Search as in integration with LangChain packages.\n\nThe following notebook shows how to convert your similarity search results to LangChain documents.\n\nVector search with the Python SDK notebook\n\nOpen notebook in new tab\n Copy link for import\n\nLoading notebook...\nNotebook examples for calling an embeddings model\n\nThe following notebooks demonstrate how to configure a Mosaic AI Model Serving endpoint for embeddings generation.\n\nCall an OpenAI embeddings model using Mosaic AI Model Serving notebook\n\nOpen notebook in new tab\n Copy link for import\n\nLoading notebook...\nCall a GTE embeddings model using Mosaic AI Model Serving notebook\n\nOpen notebook in new tab\n Copy link for import\n\nLoading notebook...\nRegister and serve an OSS embedding model notebook\n\nOpen notebook in new tab\n Copy link for import\n\nLoading notebook...\nWas this article helpful?\n\n© Databricks 2025.

Higher concurrency does not yield a higher throughput.\n\nUse a model served with provisioned throughput (for example, bge-large-en or a fine tuned version), instead of a pay-per-token foundation model.\n\nWhen to use GPUs\n\nUse CPUs only for basic testing and for small datasets (up to 100s of rows).\n\nFor GPU compute type, Databricks recommends using GPU-small or GPU-medium.\n\nFor GPU compute scale-out, choosing more concurrency might improve ingestion times, but it depends on factors such as total dataset size and index metadata.\n\nWorking with images, video, or non-text data\n\nPre-compute the embeddings and use a Delta Sync Index with self-managed embeddings.\n\nDon’t store binary formats such as images as metadata, as this adversely affects latency. Instead, store the path of the file as metadata.\n\nEmbedding sequence length\n\nCheck the embedding model sequence length to make sure documents are not being truncated. For example, BGE supports a context of 512 tokens. For longer context requirements, use gte-large-en-v1.5.\n\nUse Triggered sync mode to reduce costs\n\nThe most cost-effective option for updating a vector search index is Triggered. Only select Continuous if you need to incrementally sync the index to changes in the source table with a latency of seconds. Both sync modes perform incremental updates – only data that has changed since the last sync is processed.\n\nWas this article helpful?\n\n© Databricks 2025. All rights reserved.

For external models or provisioned throughput workloads, use AI Gateway-enabled inference tables.\n\nThis article describes inference tables for monitoring served models. The following diagram shows a typical workflow with inference tables. The inference table automatically captures incoming requests and outgoing responses for a model serving endpoint and logs them as a Unity Catalog Delta table. You can use the data in this table to monitor, debug, and improve ML models.\n\nWhat are inference tables?\n\nMonitoring the performance of models in production workflows is an important aspect of the AI and ML model lifecycle. Inference tables simplify monitoring and diagnostics for models by continuously logging serving request inputs and responses (predictions) from Mosaic AI Model Serving endpoints and saving them into a Delta table in Unity Catalog. You can then use all of the capabilities of the Databricks platform, such as Databricks SQL queries, notebooks, and Lakehouse Monitoring to monitor, debug, and optimize your models.\n\nYou can enable inference tables on any existing or newly created model serving endpoint, and requests to that endpoint are then automatically logged to a table in UC.\n\nSome common applications for inference tables are the following:\n\nMonitor data and model quality. You can continuously monitor your model performance and data drift using Lakehouse Monitoring. Lakehouse Monitoring automatically generates data and model quality dashboards that you can share with stakeholders. Additionally, you can enable alerts to know when you need to retrain your model based on shifts in incoming data or reductions in model performance.\n\nDebug production issues. Inference Tables log data like HTTP status codes, model execution times, and request and response JSON code. You can use this performance data for debugging purposes. You can also use the historical data in Inference Tables to compare model performance on historical requests.\n\nCreate a training corpus. By joining Inference Tables with ground truth labels, you can create a training corpus that you can use to re-train or fine-tune and improve your model. Using Databricks Jobs, you can set up a continuous feedback loop and automate re-training.\n\nRequirements\n\nYour workspace must have Unity Catalog enabled.\n\nBoth the creator of the endpoint and the modifier must have Can Manage permission on the endpoint. See Access control lists.\n\nBoth the creator of the endpoint and the modifier must have the following permissions in Unity Catalog:\n\nUSE CATALOG permissions on the specified catalog.\n\nUSE SCHEMA permissions on the specified schema.\n\nCREATE TABLE permissions in the schema.\n\nEnable and disable inference tables\n\nThis section shows you how to enable or disable inference tables using the Databricks UI. You can also use the API; see Enable inference tables on model serving endpoints using the API for instructions.\n\nThe owner of the inference tables is the user who created the endpoint. All access control lists (ACLs) on the table follow the standard Unity Catalog permissions and can be modified by the table owner.\n\nWarning\n\nThe inference table could become corrupted if you do any of the following:\n\nChange the table schema.\n\nChange the table name.\n\nDelete the table.\n\nLose permissions to the Unity Catalog catalog or schema.\n\nIn this case, the auto_capture_config of the endpoint status shows a FAILED state for the payload table. If this happens, you must create a new endpoint to continue using inference tables.\n\nTo enable inference tables during endpoint creation use the following steps:\n\nClick Serving in the Databricks Mosaic AI UI.\n\nClick Create serving endpoint.\n\nSelect Enable inference tables.\n\nIn the drop-down menus, select the desired catalog and schema where you would like the table to be located.\n\nThe default table name is <catalog>.<schema>.<endpoint-name>_payload. If desired, you can enter a custom table prefix.\n\nClick Create serving endpoint.\n\nYou can also enable inference tables on an existing endpoint. To edit an existing endpoint configuration do the following:\n\nNavigate to your endpoint page.\n\nClick Edit configuration.\n\nFollow the previous instructions, starting with step 3.\n\nWhen you are done, click Update serving endpoint.\n\nFollow these instructions to disable inference tables:\n\nNavigate to your endpoint page.\n\nClick Edit configuration.\n\nClick Enable inference table to remove the checkmark.\n\nOnce you are satisfied with the endpoint specifications, click Update.\n\nWorkflow: Monitor model performance using inference tables\n\nTo monitor model performance using inference tables, follow these steps:\n\nEnable inference tables on your endpoint, either during endpoint creation or by updating it afterwards.\n\nSchedule a workflow to process the JSON payloads in the inference table by unpacking them according to the schema of the endpoint.\n\n(Optional) Join the unpacked requests and responses with ground-truth labels to allow model quality metrics to be calculated.\n\nCreate a monitor over the resulting Delta table and refresh the metrics.\n\nThe starter notebooks implement this workflow.\n\nStarter notebook for monitoring an inference table\n\nThe following notebook implements the steps outlined above to unpack requests from a Lakehouse Monitoring inference table. The notebook can be run on demand, or on a recurring schedule using Databricks Jobs.\n\nInference table Lakehouse Monitoring starter notebook\n\nOpen notebook in new tab\n Copy link for import\n\nLoading notebook...\nStarter notebook for monitoring text quality from endpoints serving LLMs\n\nThe following notebook unpacks requests from an inference table, computes a set of text evaluation metrics (such as readability and toxicity), and enables monitoring over these metrics. The notebook can be run on demand, or on a recurring schedule using Databricks Jobs.\n\nLLM inference table Lakehouse Monitoring starter notebook\n\nOpen notebook in new tab\n Copy link for import\n\nLoading notebook...\nQuery and analyze results in the inference table\n\nAfter your served models are ready, all requests made to your models are logged automatically to the inference table, along with the responses. You can view the table in the UI, query the table from DBSQL or a notebook, or query the table using the REST API.\n\nTo view the table in the UI: On the endpoint page, click the name of the inference table to open the table in Catalog Explorer.\n\nTo query the table from DBSQL or a Databricks notebook: You can run code similar to the following to query the inference table.\n\nCopy\nSQL\nSELECT * FROM <catalog>.<schema>.<payload_table>\n\n\nIf you enabled inference tables using the UI, payload_table is the table name you assigned when you created the endpoint. If you enabled inference tables using the API, payload_table is reported in the state section of the auto_capture_config response. For an example, see Enable inference tables on model serving endpoints using the API.\n\nPerformance note\n\nAfter invoking the endpoint, you can see the invocation logged to your inference table within an hour of sending a scoring request. In addition, Databricks guarantees log delivery happens at least once, so it is possible, though unlikely, that duplicate logs are sent.\n\nUnity Catalog inference table schema\n\nEach request and response that gets logged to an inference table is written to a Delta table with the following schema:\n\nNote\n\nIf you invoke the endpoint with a batch of inputs, the whole batch is logged as one row.\n\nColumn name\n\n\t\n\nDescription\n\n\t\n\nType\n\n\n\n\ndatabricks_request_id\n\n\t\n\nA Databricks generated request identifier attached to all model serving requests.\n\n\t\n\nSTRING\n\n\n\n\nclient_request_id\n\n\t\n\nAn optional client generated request identifier that can be specified in the model serving request body. See Specify `client_request_id` for more information.\n\n\t\n\nSTRING\n\n\n\n\ndate\n\n\t\n\nThe UTC date on which the model serving request was received.\n\n\t\n\nDATE\n\n\n\n\ntimestamp_ms\n\n\t\n\nThe timestamp in epoch milliseconds on when the model serving request was received.\n\n\t\n\nLONG\n\n\n\n\nstatus_code\n\n\t\n\nThe HTTP status code that was returned from the model.\n\n\t\n\nINT\n\n\n\n\nsampling_fraction\n\n\t\n\nThe sampling fraction used in the event that the request was down-sampled. This value is between 0 and 1, where 1 represents that 100% of incoming requests were included.\n\n\t\n\nDOUBLE\n\n\n\n\nexecution_time_ms\n\n\t\n\nThe execution time in milliseconds for which the model performed inference. This does not include overhead network latencies and only represents the time it took for the model to generate predictions.\n\n\t\n\nLONG\n\n\n\n\nrequest\n\n\t\n\nThe raw request JSON body that was sent to the model serving endpoint.\n\n\t\n\nSTRING\n\n\n\n\nresponse\n\n\t\n\nThe raw response JSON body that was returned by the model serving endpoint.\n\n\t\n\nSTRING\n\n\n\n\nrequest_metadata\n\n\t\n\nA map of metadata related to the model serving endpoint associated with the request. This map contains the endpoint name, model name, and model version used for your endpoint.\n\n\t\n\nMAP<STRING, STRING>\n\nSpecify client_request_id\n\nThe client_request_id field is an optional value the user can provide in the model serving request body. This allows the user to provide their own identifier for a request that shows up in the final inference table under the client_request_id and can be used for joining your request with other tables that use the client_request_id, like ground truth label joining. To specify a client_request_id, include it at as a top level key of the request payload. If no client_request_id is specified, the value appears as null in the row corresponding to the request.\n\nCopy\nJSON\n{\n  \"client_request_id\": \"<user-provided-id>\",\n  \"dataframe_records\": [\n    {\n      \"sepal length (cm)\": 5.1,\n      \"sepal width (cm)\": 3.5,\n      \"petal length (cm)\": 1.4,\n      \"petal width (cm)\": 0.2\n    },\n    {\n      \"sepal length (cm)\": 4.9,\n      \"sepal width (cm)\": 3,\n      \"petal length (cm)\": 1.4,\n      \"petal width (cm)\": 0.2\n    },\n    {\n      \"sepal length (cm)\": 4.7,\n      \"sepal width (cm)\": 3.2,\n      \"petal length (cm)\": 1.3,\n      \"petal width (cm)\": 0.2\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n\nThe client_request_id can later be used for ground truth label joins if there are other tables that have labels associated with the client_request_id.\n\nLimitations\n\nCustomer managed keys are not supported.\n\nFor endpoints that host foundation models, inference tables are only supported on provisioned throughput workloads.\n\nAWS PrivateLink is not supported by default. Reach out to your Databricks account team to enable it.\n\nWhen inference tables is enabled, the limit for the total max concurrency across all served models in a single endpoint is 128. Reach out to your Databricks account team to request an increase to this limit.\n\nIf an inference table contains more than 500K files, no additional data is logged. To avoid exceeding this limit, run OPTIMIZE or set up retention on your table by deleting older data. To check the number of files in your table, run DESCRIBE DETAIL <catalog>.<schema>.<payload_table>.\n\nInference tables log delivery is currently best effort, but you can expect logs to be available within 1 hour of a request. Reach out to your Databricks account team for more information.\n\nFor general model serving endpoint limitations, see Model Serving limits and regions.\n\nWas this article helpful?\n\n© Databricks 2025.

Make & evaluate quality fixes on the AI agent  Step 6 (pipelines). Implement data pipeline fixes\nStep 6 (pipelines). Implement data pipeline fixes\n\nOctober 09, 2024\n\nFollow these steps to modify your data pipeline and run it to:\n\nCreate a new vector index.\n\nCreate an MLflow run with the data pipeline’s metadata.\n\nThe resulting MLflow run is referenced by the `B_quality_iteration/02_evaluate_fixes` notebook.\n\nThere are two approaches to modifying the data pipeline:\n\nImplement a single fix at a time In this approach, you configure and run a single data pipeline at once. This mode is best if you want to try a single embedding model and test out a single new parser. Databricks suggests starting here to get familiar with these notebooks.\n\nImplement multiple fix at once In this approach, also called a sweep, you, in parallel, run multiple data pipelines that each have a different configuration. This mode is best if you want to “sweep” across many different strategies, for example, evaluate three PDF parsers or evaluate many different chunk sizes.\n\nSee the GitHub repository for the sample code in this section.\n\nApproach 1: Implement a single fix at a time\n\nOpen the B_quality_iteration/data_pipeline_fixes/single_fix/00_config notebook\n\nFollow the instructions in one of the below:\n\nFollow the instructions to implement a new configuration provided by this tutorial.\n\nFollow the steps to implement custom code for a parsing or chunking.\n\nRun the pipeline, by either:\n\nOpening & running the 00_Run_Entire_Pipeline notebook.\n\nFollowing the steps to run each step of the pipeline manually.\n\nAdd the name of the resulting MLflow Run that is outputted to the DATA_PIPELINE_FIXES_RUN_NAMES variable in B_quality_iteration/02_evaluate_fixes notebook\n\nNote\n\nThe data preparation pipeline employs Spark Structured Streaming to incrementally load and process files. This entails that files already loaded and prepared are tracked in checkpoints and won’t be reprocessed. Only newly added files will be loaded, prepared, and appended to the corresponding tables.\n\nTherefore, if you wish to rerun the entire pipeline from scratch and reprocess all documents, you need to delete the checkpoints and tables. You can accomplish this by using the reset_tables_and_checkpoints notebook.\n\nApproach 2: Implement multiple fix at once\n\nOpen the B_quality_iteration/data_pipeline_fixes/multiple_fixes/00_Run_Multiple_Pipelines notebook.\n\nFollow the instructions in the notebook to add two or more configurations of the data pipeline to run.\n\nRun the notebook to execute these pipelines.\n\nAdd the names of the resulting MLflow runs that are outputted to the DATA_PIPELINE_FIXES_RUN_NAMES variable in B_quality_iteration/02_evaluate_fixes notebook.\n\nAppendix\n\nNote\n\nYou can find the notebooks referenced below in the single_fix and multiple_fixes directories depending on whether you are implementing a single fix or multiple fixes at a time.\n\nConfiguration settings deep dive\n\nThe various pre-implemented configuration options for the data pipeline are listed below. Alternatively, you can implement a custom parser/chunker.\n\nvectorsearch_config: Specify the vector search endpoint (must be up and running) and the name of the index to be created. Additionally, define the synchronization type between the source table and the index (default is TRIGGERED).\n\nembedding_config: Specify the embedding model to be used, along with the tokenizer. For a complete list of options see the `supporting_configs/embedding_models` notebook. The embedding model has to be deployed to a running model serving endpoint. Depending on chunking strategy, the tokenizer is also during splitting to make sure the chunks do not exceed the token limit of the embedding model. Tokenizers are used here to count the number of tokens in the text chunks to ensure that they don’t exceed the maximum context length of the selected embedding model.\n\nThe following shows a tokenizer from HuggingFace:\n\nCopy\nPython\n    \"embedding_tokenizer\": {\n        \"tokenizer_model_name\": \"BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5\",\n        \"tokenizer_source\": \"hugging_face\",\n    }\n\n\nThe following shows a tokenizer from TikToken:\n\nCopy\nPython\n\"embedding_tokenizer\": {\n        \"tokenizer_model_name\": \"text-embedding-small\",\n        \"tokenizer_source\": \"tiktoken\",\n    }\n\n\npipeline_config: Defines the file parser, chunker and path to the sources field. Parsers and chunkers are defined in the parser_library and chunker_library notebooks, respectively. These can be found in the single_fix and multiple_fixes directories. For a complete list of options see the supporting_configs/parser_chunker_strategies notebook, which is again available in both the single and multiple fix directories. Different parsers or chunkers may require different configuration parameters where <param x> represent the potential parameters required for a specific chunker. Parsers can also be passed configuration values using the same format.\n\nCopy\nPython\n    \"chunker\": {\n        \"name\": <chunker-name>,\n        \"config\": {\n            \"<param 1>\": \"...\",\n            \"<param 2>\": \"...\",\n            ...\n        }\n    }\n\nImplementing a custom parser/chunker\n\nThis project is structured to facilitate the addition of custom parsers or chunkers to the data preparation pipeline.\n\nAdd a new parser\n\nSuppose you want to incorporate a new parser using the PyMuPDF library to transform parsed text into Markdown format. Follow these steps:\n\nInstall the required dependencies by adding the following code to the parser_library notebook in the single_fix or multiple_fix directory:\n\nCopy\nPython\n# Dependencies for PyMuPdf\n%pip install pymupdf pymupdf4llm\n\n\nIn the parser_library notebook in the single_fix or multiple_fix directory, add a new section for the PyMuPdfMarkdown parser and implement the parsing function. Ensure the output of the function complies with the ParserReturnValue class defined at the beginning of the notebook. This ensures compatibility with Spark UDFs. The try or except block prevents Spark from failing the entire parsing job due to errors in individual documents when applying the parser as a UDF in 02_parse_docs notebook in the single_fix or multiple_fix directory. This notebook will check if parsing failed for any document, quarantine the corresponding rows and raise a warning.\n\nCopy\nPython\nimport fitz\nimport pymupdf4llm\n\ndef parse_bytes_pymupdfmarkdown(\n    raw_doc_contents_bytes: bytes,\n) -> ParserReturnValue:\n    try:\n        pdf_doc = fitz.Document(stream=raw_doc_contents_bytes, filetype=\"pdf\")\n        md_text = pymupdf4llm.to_markdown(pdf_doc)\n\n        output = {\n            \"num_pages\": str(pdf_doc.page_count),\n            \"parsed_content\": md_text.strip(),\n        }\n\n        return {\n            OUTPUT_FIELD_NAME: output,\n            STATUS_FIELD_NAME: \"SUCCESS\",\n        }\n    except Exception as e:\n        warnings.warn(f\"Exception {e} has been thrown during parsing\")\n        return {\n            OUTPUT_FIELD_NAME: {\"num_pages\": \"\", \"parsed_content\": \"\"},\n            STATUS_FIELD_NAME: f\"ERROR: {e}\",\n        }\n\n\nAdd your new parsing function to the parser_factory in the parser_library notebook in the single_fix or multiple_fix directory to make it configurable in the pipeline_config of the 00_config notebook.\n\nIn the 02_parse_docs notebook, parser functions are turned into Spark Python UDFs (arrow-optimized for Databricks Runtime 14.0 or above) and applied to the dataframe containing the new binary PDF files. For testing and development, add a simple testing function to the parser_library notebook that loads the test-document.pdf file and asserts successful parsing:\n\nCopy\nPython\nwith open(\"./test_data/test-document.pdf\", \"rb\") as file:\n    file_bytes = file.read()\n    test_result_pymupdfmarkdown = parse_bytes_pymupdfmarkdown(file_bytes)\n\nassert test_result_pymupdfmarkdown[STATUS_FIELD_NAME] == \"SUCCESS\"\n\nAdd a new chunker\n\nThe process for adding a new chunker follows similar steps to those explained above for a new parser.\n\nAdd the required dependencies in the chunker_library notebook.\n\nAdd a new section for your chunker and implement a function, e.g., chunk_parsed_content_newchunkername. The output of the new chunker function must be a Python dictionary that complies with the ChunkerReturnValue class defined at the beginning of the chunker_library notebook. The function should accept at least a string of the parsed text to be chunked. If your chunker requires additional parameters, you can add them as function parameters.\n\nAdd your new chunker to the chunker_factory function defined in the chunker_library notebook. If your function accepts additional parameters, use functools’ partial to pre-configure them. This is necessary because UDFs only accept one input parameter, which will be the parsed text in our case. The chunker_factory enables you to configure different chunker methods in the pipeline_config and returns a Spark Python UDF (optimized for Databricks Runtime 14.0 and above).\n\nAdd a simple testing section for your new chunking function. This section should chunk a predefined text provided as a string.\n\nPerformance tuning\n\nSpark utilizes partitions to parallelize processing. Data is divided into chunks of rows, and each partition is processed by a single core by default. However, when data is initially read by Apache Spark, it may not create partitions optimized for the desired computation, particularly for our UDFs performing parsing and chunking tasks. It’s crucial to strike a balance between creating partitions that are small enough for efficient parallelization and not so small that the overhead of managing them outweighs the benefits.\n\nYou can adjust the number of partitions using df.repartitions(<number of partitions>). When applying UDFs, aim for a multiple of the number of cores available on the worker nodes. For instance, in the 02_parse_docs notebook, you could include df_raw_bronze = df_raw_bronze.repartition(2*sc.defaultParallelism) to create twice as many partitions as the number of available worker cores. Typically, a multiple between 1 and 3 should yield satisfactory performance.\n\nRunning the pipeline manually\n\nAlternatively, you can run each individual Notebook step-by-step:\n\nLoad the raw files using the 01_load_files notebook. This saves each document binary as one record in a bronze table (raw_files_table_name) defined in the destination_tables_config. Files are loaded incrementally, processing only new documents since the last run.\n\nParse the documents with the 02_parse_docs notebook. This notebook executes the parser_library notebook (ensure to run this as the first cell to restart Python), making different parsers and related utilities available. It then uses the specified parser in the pipeline_config to parse each document into plain text. As an example, relevant metadata like the number of pages of the original PDF alongside the parsed text is captured. Successfully parsed documents are stored in a silver table (parsed_docs_table_name), while any unparsed documents are quarantined into a corresponding table.\n\nChunk the parsed documents using the 03_chunk_docs notebook. Similar to parsing, this notebook executes the chunker_library notebook (again, run as the first cell). It splits each parsed document into smaller chunks using the specified chunker from the pipeline_config. Each chunk is assigned a unique ID using an MD5 hash, necessary for synchronization with the vector search index. The final chunks are loaded into a gold table (chunked_docs_table_name).\n\nCreate/Sync the vector search index with the 04_vector_index. This notebook verifies the readiness of the specified vector search endpoint in the vectorsearch_config. If the configured index already exists, it initiates synchronization with the gold table; otherwise, it creates the index and triggers synchronization. This is expected to take some time if the Vector Search endpoint and index have not yet been created.\n\nNext step\n\nContinue with Step 7. Deploy & monitor.\n\n< Previous: Step 6. Iteratively fix quality issues\n\nNext: Step 7. Deploy & monitor the POC >\n\n© Databricks 2025. All rights reserved.

Use this page when root cause analysis indicates a root cause Improve Retrieval.\n\nRetrieval quality is arguably the most important component of a RAG application. If the most relevant chunks are not returned for a given query, the LLM does not have access to the necessary information to generate a high-quality response. Poor retrieval can lead to irrelevant, incomplete, or hallucinated output. This step requires manual effort to analyze the underlying data. Mosaic AI Agent Framework, with its tight integration between the data platform (including Unity Catalog and Vector Search), and experiment tracking with MLflow (including LLM evaluation and MLflow Tracing) makes troubleshooting much easier.\n\nInstructions\n\nFollow these steps to address retrieval quality issues:\n\nOpen the B_quality_iteration/01_root_cause_quality_issues notebook.\n\nUse the queries to load MLflow traces of the records that had retrieval quality issues.\n\nFor each record, manually examine the retrieved chunks.

For example:\n\nRelevant information is missing from the vector database entirely.\n\nInsufficient number of chunks or documents returned for a retrieval query.\n\nChunks are too small and lack sufficient context.\n\nChunks are too large and contain multiple, unrelated topics.\n\nThe embedding model fails to capture semantic similarity for domain-specific terms.\n\nBased on the identified issue, hypothesize potential root causes and corresponding fixes. For guidance, see Common reasons for poor retrieval quality.\n\nFollow the steps in implement and evaluate changes to implement and evaluate a potential fix.

Measuring quality is not easy and requires a significant infrastructure investment.\n\nDetailed trace logging\n\nThe core of your RAG application’s logic is a series of steps in the chain. To evaluate and debug quality, you need to implement instrumentation that tracks the chain’s inputs and outputs, along with each step of the chain, and its associated inputs and outputs. The instrumentation you put in place should work the same way in development and production.\n\nIn Databricks, MLflow Tracing provides this capability. With MLflow Trace Logging, you instrument your code in production, and get the same traces during development and in production. Production traces are logged as part of the Inference Table.\n\nStakeholder review UI\n\nMost often, as a developer, you are not a domain expert in the content of the application you are developing. In order to collect feedback from human experts who can assess your application’s output quality, you need an interface that allows them to interact with early versions of the application and provide detailed feedback. Further, you need a way to load specific application outputs for the stakeholders to assess their quality.\n\nThis interface must track the application’s outputs and associated feedback in a structured manner, storing the full application trace and detailed feedback in a data table.\n\nIn Databricks, the Agent Evaluation Review App provides this capability.\n\nQuality, cost, and latency metric framework\n\nYou need a way to define the metrics that comprehensively measure the quality of each component of your chain and the end-to-end application. Ideally, the framework would provide a suite of standard metrics out of the box, in addition to supporting customization, so you can add metrics that test specific aspects of quality that are unique to your business.\n\nIn Databricks, Agent Evaluation provides an out-of-the-box implementation, using hosted LLM judge models, for the necessary quality, cost, and latency metrics.\n\nEvaluation harness\n\nYou need a way to quickly and efficiently get outputs from your chain for every question in your evaluation set, and then evaluate each output on the relevant metrics. This harness must be as efficient as possible, since you will run evaluation after every experiment that you try to improve quality.\n\nIn Databricks, Agent Evaluation provides an evaluation harness that is integrated with MLflow.\n\nEvaluation set management\n\nYour evaluation set is a living, breathing set of questions that you will update iteratively over the course of your application’s development and production lifecycle.\n\nIn Databricks, you can manage your evaluation set as a Delta Table. When evaluating with MLflow, MLflow will automatically log a snapshot of the version of the evaluation set used.\n\nExperiment tracking framework\n\nDuring the course of your application development, you will try many different experiments. An experiment tracking framework enables you to log each experiment and track its metrics vs. other experiments.\n\nIn Databricks, MLflow provides experiment tracking capabilities.\n\nChain parameterization framework\n\nMany experiments you try require you to hold the chain’s code constant while iterating on various parameters used by the code. You need a framework that enables you to do this.\n\nIn Databricks, MLflow model configuration provides these capabilities.\n\nOnline monitoring\n\nOnce deployed, you need a way monitor the application’s health and on-going quality, cost, and latency.\n\nIn Databricks, Model Serving provides application health monitoring and Lakehouse Monitoring provides on-going outputs to a dashboard and monitors quality, cost, and latency.\n\n< Previous: Assess performance\n\nNext: Evaluation-driven development >\n\nWas this article helpful?\n\n© Databricks 2025.

Precision and recall are two key retrieval metrics.\n\nResponse quality: Response quality metrics assess how well the RAG application responds to a user’s request. Response metrics can measure, for instance, if the resulting answer is accurate per the ground-truth, how well-grounded the response was given the retrieved context (for instance, did the LLM hallucinate?), or how safe the response was (in other words, no toxicity).\n\nSystem performance (cost & latency): Metrics capture the overall cost and performance of RAG applications. Overall latency and token consumption are examples of chain performance metrics.\n\nIt is very important to collect both response and retrieval metrics. A RAG application can respond poorly despite retrieving the correct context; it can also provide good responses based on faulty retrievals. Only by measuring both components can we accurately diagnose and address issues in the application.\n\nApproaches to measuring performance\n\nThere are two key approaches to measuring performance across these metrics:\n\nDeterministic measurement: Cost and latency metrics can be computed deterministically based on the application’s outputs. If your evaluation set includes a list of documents that contain the answer to a question, a subset of the retrieval metrics can also be computed deterministically.\n\nLLM judge-based measurement: In this approach, a separate LLM acts as a judge to evaluate the quality of the RAG application’s retrieval and responses. Some LLM judges, such as answer correctness, compare the human-labeled ground truth vs. the app outputs. Other LLM judges, such as groundedness, do not require human-labeled ground truth to assess their app outputs.\n\nImportant\n\nFor an LLM judge to be effective, it must be tuned to understand the use case. Doing so requires careful attention to understand where the judge does and does not work well, and then tuning the judge to improve it for the failure cases.\n\nMosaic AI Agent Evaluation provides an out-of-the-box implementation, using hosted LLM judge models, for each metric discussed on this page. Agent Evaluation’s documentation discusses the details of how these metrics and judges are implemented and provides capabilities to tune the judges with your data to increase their accuracy\n\nMetrics overview\n\nBelow is a summary of the metrics that Databricks recommends for measuring the quality, cost, and latency of your RAG application. These metrics are implemented in Mosaic AI Agent Evaluation.\n\nDimension\n\n\t\n\nMetric name\n\n\t\n\nQuestion\n\n\t\n\nMeasured by\n\n\t\n\nNeeds ground truth?\n\n\n\n\nRetrieval\n\n\t\n\nchunk_relevance/precision\n\n\t\n\nWhat % of the retrieved chunks are relevant to the request?\n\n\t\n\nLLM judge\n\n\t\n\nNo\n\n\n\n\nRetrieval\n\n\t\n\ndocument_recall\n\n\t\n\nWhat % of the ground truth documents are represented in the retrieved chunks?\n\n\t\n\nDeterministic\n\n\t\n\nYes\n\n\n\n\nRetrieval\n\n\t\n\ncontext_sufficiency\n\n\t\n\nAre the retrieved chunks sufficiency to produce the expected response?\n\n\t\n\nLLM Judge\n\n\t\n\nYes\n\n\n\n\nResponse\n\n\t\n\ncorrectness\n\n\t\n\nOverall, did the agent generate a correct response?\n\n\t\n\nLLM judge\n\n\t\n\nYes\n\n\n\n\nResponse\n\n\t\n\nrelevance_to_query\n\n\t\n\nIs the response relevant to the request?\n\n\t\n\nLLM judge\n\n\t\n\nNo\n\n\n\n\nResponse\n\n\t\n\ngroundedness\n\n\t\n\nIs the response a hallucination or grounded in context?\n\n\t\n\nLLM judge\n\n\t\n\nNo\n\n\n\n\nResponse\n\n\t\n\nsafety\n\n\t\n\nIs there harmful content in the response?\n\n\t\n\nLLM judge\n\n\t\n\nNo\n\n\n\n\nCost\n\n\t\n\ntotal_token_count, total_input_token_count, total_output_token_count\n\n\t\n\nWhat’s the total count of tokens for LLM generations?\n\n\t\n\nDeterministic\n\n\t\n\nNo\n\n\n\n\nLatency\n\n\t\n\nlatency_seconds\n\n\t\n\nWhat’s the latency of executing the app?\n\n\t\n\nDeterministic\n\n\t\n\nNo\n\nHow retrieval metrics work\n\nRetrieval metrics help you understand if your retriever is delivering relevant results.

An LLM judge can be used to assess the relevance of each retrieved chunk to the user’s request.\n\n\n\n\nRecall\n\n\t\n\nWhat % of the ground truth documents are represented in the retrieved chunks?\n\n\t\n\nRecall is the proportion of the ground truth documents that are represented in the retrieved chunks. This is a measure of the completeness of the results.\n\nPrecision and recall\n\nBelow is a quick primer on Precision and recall adapted from the excellent Wikipedia article.\n\nPrecision formula\n\nPrecision measures “Of the chunks I retrieved, what % of these items are actually relevant to my user’s query?” Computing precision does not require knowing all relevant items.\n\nRecall formula\n\nRecall measures “Of ALL the documents that I know are relevant to my user’s query, what % did I retrieve a chunk from?” Computing recall requires your ground-truth to contain all relevant items. Items can either be a document or a chunk of a document.\n\nIn the example below, two out of the three retrieved results were relevant to the user’s query, so the precision was 0.66 (2/3). The retrieved docs included two out of a total of four relevant docs, so the recall was 0.5 (2/4).\n\n< Previous: Define quality\n\nNext: Enable evaluation >\n\nWas this article helpful?\n\n© Databricks 2025.

This pipeline is responsible for preparing the unstructured data in a format that can be effectively utilized by the RAG application. While this data pipeline can become arbitrarily complex, the following are the key components you need to think about when first building your RAG application:\n\nCorpus composition: Selecting the right data sources and content based on the specific use case.\n\nParsing: Extracting relevant information from the raw data using appropriate parsing techniques.\n\nChunking: Breaking down the parsed data into smaller, manageable chunks for efficient retrieval.\n\nEmbedding: Converting the chunked text data into a numerical vector representation that captures its semantic meaning.\n\nCorpus composition\n\nWithout the right data corpus, your RAG application can’t retrieve the information required to answer a user query. The right data is entirely dependent on the specific requirements and goals of your application, making it crucial to dedicate time to understand the nuances of data available (see the requirements gathering section for guidance on this).\n\nFor example, when building a customer support bot, you might consider including:\n\nKnowledge base documents\n\nFrequently asked questions (FAQs)\n\nProduct manuals and specifications\n\nTroubleshooting guides\n\nEngage domain experts and stakeholders from the outset of any project to help identify and curate relevant content that could improve the quality and coverage of your data corpus. They can provide insights into the types of queries that users are likely to submit, and help prioritize the most important information to include.\n\nParsing\n\nHaving identified the data sources for your RAG application, the next step is extracting the required information from the raw data. This process, known as parsing, involves transforming the unstructured data into a format that can be effectively utilized by the RAG application.\n\nThe specific parsing techniques and tools you use depend on the type of data you are working with. For example:\n\nText documents (PDFs, Word docs): Off-the-shelf libraries like unstructured and PyPDF2 can handle various file formats and provide options for customizing the parsing process.\n\nHTML documents: HTML parsing libraries like BeautifulSoup can be used to extract relevant content from web pages. With them, you can navigate the HTML structure, select specific elements, and extract the desired text or attributes.\n\nImages and scanned documents: Optical Character Recognition (OCR) techniques are typically be required to extract text from images. Popular OCR libraries include Tesseract, Amazon Textract, Azure AI Vision OCR, and Google Cloud Vision API.\n\nBest practices for parsing data\n\nWhen parsing your data, consider the following best practices:\n\nData cleaning: Preprocess the extracted text to remove any irrelevant or noisy information, such as headers, footers, or special characters. Be cognizant of reducing the amount of unnecessary or malformed information that your RAG chain needs to process.\n\nHandling errors and exceptions: Implement error handling and logging mechanisms to identify and resolve any issues encountered during the parsing process. This helps you quickly identify and fix problems. Doing so often points to upstream issues with the quality of the source data.\n\nCustomizing parsing logic: Depending on the structure and format of your data, you may need to customize the parsing logic to extract the most relevant information. While it may require additional effort upfront, invest the time to do this if required—it often prevents a lot of downstream quality issues.\n\nEvaluating parsing quality: Regularly assess the quality of the parsed data by manually reviewing a sample of the output. This can help you identify any issues or areas for improvement in the parsing process.\n\nChunking\n\nAfter parsing the raw data into a more structured format, the next step is to break it down into smaller, manageable units called chunks. Segmenting large documents into smaller, semantically concentrated chunks, ensures that retrieved data fits in the LLM’s context, while minimizing the inclusion of distracting or irrelevant information. The choices made on chunking will directly affect what retrieved data the LLM is provided, making it one of the first layers of optimization in a RAG application.\n\nWhen chunking your data, consider the following factors:\n\nChunking strategy: The method you use to divide the original text into chunks. This can involve basic techniques such as splitting by sentences, paragraphs, or specific character/token counts, through to more advanced document-specific splitting strategies.\n\nChunk size: Smaller chunks may focus on specific details but lose some surrounding information. Larger chunks may capture more context but can also include irrelevant information.\n\nOverlap between chunks: To ensure that important information is not lost when splitting the data into chunks, consider including some overlap between adjacent chunks. Overlapping can ensure continuity and context preservation across chunks.\n\nSemantic coherence: When possible, aim to create chunks that are semantically coherent, meaning they contain related information and can stand on their own as a meaningful unit of text. This can be achieved by considering the structure of the original data, such as paragraphs, sections, or topic boundaries.\n\nMetadata: Including relevant metadata within each chunk, such as the source document name, section heading, or product names can improve the retrieval process. This additional information in the chunk can help match retrieval queries to chunks.\n\nData chunking strategies\n\nFinding the right chunking method is both iterative and context-dependent. There is no one-size-fits all approach; the optimal chunk size and method will depend on the specific use case and the nature of the data being processed. Broadly speaking, chunking strategies can be viewed as the following:\n\nFixed-size chunking: Split the text into chunks of a predetermined size, such as a fixed number of characters or tokens (for example, LangChain CharacterTextSplitter). While splitting by an arbitrary number of characters/tokens is quick and easy to set up, it will typically not result in consistent semantically coherent chunks.\n\nParagraph-based chunking: Use the natural paragraph boundaries in the text to define chunks. This method can help preserve the semantic coherence of the chunks, as paragraphs often contain related information (for example, LangChain RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter).\n\nFormat-specific chunking: Formats such as markdown or HTML have an inherent structure within them which can be used to define chunk boundaries (for example, markdown headers). Tools like LangChain’s MarkdownHeaderTextSplitter or HTML header/section-based splitters can be used for this purpose.\n\nSemantic chunking: Techniques such as topic modeling can be applied to identify semantically coherent sections within the text. These approaches analyze the content or structure of each document to determine the most appropriate chunk boundaries based on shifts in topic. Although more involved than more basic approaches, semantic chunking can help create chunks that are more aligned with the natural semantic divisions in the text (see LangChain SemanticChunker for an example of this).\n\nExample: Fix-sized chunking\n\nFixed-size chunking example using LangChain’s RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter with chunk_size=100 and chunk_overlap=20. ChunkViz provides an interactive way to visualize how different chunk size and chunk overlap values with Langchain’s character splitters affects resulting chunks.\n\nEmbedding model\n\nAfter chunking your data, the next step is to convert the text chunks into a vector representation using an embedding model. An embedding model is used to convert each text chunk into a vector representation that captures its semantic meaning. By representing chunks as dense vectors, embeddings allow for fast and accurate retrieval of the most relevant chunks based on their semantic similarity to a retrieval query. At query time, the retrieval query will be transformed using the same embedding model that was used to embed chunks in the data pipeline.\n\nWhen selecting an embedding model, consider the following factors:\n\nModel choice: Each embedding model has its nuances, and the available benchmarks may not capture the specific characteristics of your data. Experiment with different off-the-shelf embedding models, even those that may be lower-ranked on standard leaderboards like MTEB. Some examples to consider include:\n\nGTE-Large-v1.5\n\nOpenAI’s text-embedding-ada-002, text-embedding-large, and text-embedding-small\n\nMax tokens: Be aware of the maximum token limit for your chosen embedding model. If you pass chunks that exceed this limit, they will be truncated, potentially losing important information. For example, bge-large-en-v1.5 has a maximum token limit of 512.\n\nModel size: Larger embedding models generally offer better performance but require more computational resources. Strike a balance between performance and efficiency based on your specific use case and available resources.\n\nFine-tuning: If your RAG application deals with domain-specific language (e.g., internal company acronyms or terminology), consider fine-tuning the embedding model on domain-specific data. This can help the model better capture the nuances and terminology of your particular domain, and can often lead to improved retrieval performance.\n\n< Previous: Improve RAG app quality\n\nNext: Improve RAG chain quality >\n\nWas this article helpful?\n\n© Databricks 2025.

While the exact steps within a RAG chain can vary widely depending on the use case and requirements, the following are the key components to consider when building your RAG chain:\n\nQuery understanding: Analyzing and transforming user queries to better represent intent and extract relevant information, such as filters or keywords, to improve the retrieval process.\n\nRetrieval: Finding the most relevant chunks of information given a retrieval query. In the unstructured data case, this typically involves one or a combination of semantic or keyword-based search.\n\nPrompt augmentation: Combining a user query with retrieved information and instructions to guide the LLM towards generating high-quality responses.\n\nLLM: Selecting the most appropriate model (and model parameters) for your application to optimize/balance performance, latency, and cost.\n\nPost-processing and guardrails: Applying additional processing steps and safety measures to ensure the LLM-generated responses are on-topic, factually consistent, and adhere to specific guidelines or constraints.\n\nIteratively implement & evaluate quality fixes shows you how to iterate over the components of a chain.\n\nQuery understanding\n\nUsing the user query directly as a retrieval query can work for some queries. However, it is generally beneficial to reformulate the query before the retrieval step. Query understanding comprises a step (or series of steps) at the beginning of a chain to analyze and transform user queries to better represent intent, extract relevant information, and ultimately help the subsequent retrieval process. Approaches to transforming a user query to improve retrieval include:\n\nQuery rewriting: Query rewriting involves translating a user query into one or more queries that better represent the original intent. The goal is to reformulate the query in a way that increases the likelihood of the retrieval step finding the most relevant documents. This can be particularly useful when dealing with complex or ambiguous queries that might not directly match the terminology used in the retrieval documents.\n\nExamples:\n\nParaphrasing conversation history in a multi-turn chat\n\nCorrecting spelling mistakes in the user’s query\n\nReplacing words or phrases in the user query with synonyms to capture a broader range of relevant documents\n\nImportant\n\nQuery rewriting must be done in conjunction with changes to the retrieval component\n\nFilter extraction: In some cases, user queries may contain specific filters or criteria that can be used to narrow down the search results. Filter extraction involves identifying and extracting these filters from the query and passing them to the retrieval step as additional parameters. This can help improve the relevance of the retrieved documents by focusing on specific subsets of the available data.\n\nExamples:\n\nExtracting specific time periods mentioned in the query, such as “articles from the last 6 months” or “reports from 2023”.\n\nIdentifying mentions of specific products, services, or categories in the query, such as “Databricks Professional Services” or “laptops”.\n\nExtracting geographic entities from the query, such as city names or country codes.\n\nNote\n\nFilter extraction must be done in conjunction with changes to both metadata extraction data pipeline and retriever chain components. The metadata extraction step should ensure that the relevant metadata fields are available for each document/chunk, and the retrieval step should be implemented to accept and apply extracted filters.\n\nIn addition to query rewriting and filter extraction, another important consideration in query understanding is whether to use a single LLM call or multiple calls. While using a single call with a carefully crafted prompt can be efficient, there are cases where breaking down the query understanding process into multiple LLM calls can lead to better results. This, by the way, is a generally applicable rule of thumb when you are trying to implement a number of complex logic steps into a single prompt.\n\nFor example, you might use one LLM call to classify the query intent, another to extract relevant entities, and a third to rewrite the query based on the extracted information. Although this approach may add some latency to the overall process, it can allow for more fine-grained control and potentially improve the quality of the retrieved documents.\n\nMultistep query understanding for a support bot\n\nHere’s how a multi-step query understanding component might look for a customer support bot:\n\nIntent classification: Use an LLM to classify the user’s query into predefined categories, such as “product information”, “troubleshooting”, or “account management”.\n\nEntity extraction: Based on the identified intent, use another LLM call to extract relevant entities from the query, such as product names, reported errors, or account numbers.\n\nQuery rewriting: Use the extracted intent and entities to rewrite the original query into a more specific and targeted format, for example, “My RAG chain is failing to deploy on Model Serving, I’m seeing the following error…”.\n\nRetrieval\n\nThe retrieval component of the RAG chain is responsible for finding the most relevant chunks of information given a retrieval query. In the context of unstructured data, retrieval typically involves one or a combination of semantic search, keyword-based search, and metadata filtering. The choice of retrieval strategy depends on the specific requirements of your application, the nature of the data, and the types of queries you expect to handle. Let’s compare these options:\n\nSemantic search: Semantic search uses an embedding model to convert each chunk of text into a vector representation that captures its semantic meaning. By comparing the vector representation of the retrieval query with the vector representations of the chunks, semantic search can retrieve conceptually similar documents, even if they don’t contain the exact keywords from the query.\n\nKeyword-based search: Keyword-based search determines the relevance of documents by analyzing the frequency and distribution of shared words between the retrieval query and the indexed documents. The more often the same words appear in both the query and a document, the higher the relevance score assigned to that document.\n\nHybrid search: Hybrid search combines the strengths of both semantic and keyword-based search by employing a two-step retrieval process. First, it performs a semantic search to retrieve a set of conceptually relevant documents. Then, it applies keyword-based search on this reduced set to further refine the results based on exact keyword matches. Finally, it combines the scores from both steps to rank the documents.\n\nCompare retrieval strategies\n\nThe following table contrasts each of these retrieval strategies against one another:\n\n\t\n\nSemantic search\n\n\t\n\nKeyword search\n\n\t\n\nHybrid search\n\n\n\n\nSimple explanation\n\n\t\n\nIf the same concepts appear in the query and a potential document, they are relevant.\n\n\t\n\nIf the same words appear in the query and a potential document, they are relevant. The more words from the query in the document, the more relevant that document is.\n\n\t\n\nRuns BOTH a semantic search and keyword search, then combines the results.\n\n\n\n\nExample use case\n\n\t\n\nCustomer support where user queries are different than the words in the product manuals. Example: “how do i turn my phone on?” and the manual section is called “toggling the power”.\n\n\t\n\nCustomer support where queries contain specific, non descriptive technical terms. Example: “what does model HD7-8D do?”\n\n\t\n\nCustomer support queries that combined both semantic and technical terms. Example: “how do I turn on my HD7-8D?”\n\n\n\n\nTechnical approaches\n\n\t\n\nUses embeddings to represent text in a continuous vector space, enabling semantic search.\n\n\t\n\nRelies on discrete token-based methods like bag-of-words, TF-IDF, BM25 for keyword matching.\n\n\t\n\nUse a re-ranking approach to combine the results, such as reciprocal rank fusion or a re-ranking model.\n\n\n\n\nStrengths\n\n\t\n\nRetrieving contextually similar information to a query, even if the exact words are not used.\n\n\t\n\nScenarios requiring precise keyword matches, ideal for specific term-focused queries such as product names.\n\n\t\n\nCombines the best of both approaches.\n\nWays to enhance the retrieval process\n\nIn addition to these core retrieval strategies, there are several techniques you can apply to further enhance the retrieval process:\n\nQuery expansion: Query expansion can help capture a broader range of relevant documents by using multiple variations of the retrieval query. This can be achieved by either conducting individual searches for each expanded query, or using a concatenation of all expanded search queries in a single retrieval query.\n\nNote\n\nQuery expansion must be done in conjunction with changes to the query understanding component (RAG chain). The multiple variations of a retrieval query are typically generated in this step.\n\nRe-ranking: After retrieving an initial set of chunks, apply additional ranking criteria (for example, sort by time) or a reranker model to re-order the results. Re-ranking can help prioritize the most relevant chunks given a specific retrieval query. Reranking with cross-encoder models such as mxbai-rerank and ColBERTv2 can yield an uplift in retrieval performance.\n\nMetadata filtering: Use metadata filters extracted from the query understanding step to narrow down the search space based on specific criteria. Metadata filters can include attributes like document type, creation date, author, or domain-specific tags. By combining metadata filters with semantic or keyword-based search, you can create more targeted and efficient retrieval.\n\nNote\n\nMetadata filtering must be done in conjunction with changes to the query understanding (RAG chain) and metadata extraction (data pipeline) components.\n\nPrompt augmentation\n\nPrompt augmentation is the step where the user query is combined with the retrieved information and instructions in a prompt template to guide the language model toward generating high-quality responses. Iterating on this template to optimize the prompt provided to the LLM (AKA prompt engineering) is required to ensure that the model is guided to produce accurate, grounded, and coherent responses.\n\nThere are entire guides to prompt engineering, but here are some considerations to keep in mind when you’re iterating on the prompt template:\n\nProvide examples\n\nInclude examples of well-formed queries and their corresponding ideal responses within the prompt template itself (few-shot learning). This helps the model understand the desired format, style, and content of the responses.\n\nOne useful way to come up with good examples is to identify types of queries your chain struggles with. Create gold-standard responses for those queries and include them as examples in the prompt.\n\nEnsure that the examples you provide are representative of user queries you anticipate at inference time. Aim to cover a diverse range of expected queries to help the model generalize better.\n\nParameterize your prompt template\n\nDesign your prompt template to be flexible by parameterizing it to incorporate additional information beyond the retrieved data and user query. This could be variables such as current date, user context, or other relevant metadata.\n\nInjecting these variables into the prompt at inference time can enable more personalized or context-aware responses.\n\nConsider Chain-of-Thought prompting\n\nFor complex queries where direct answers aren’t readily apparent, consider Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting. This prompt engineering strategy breaks down complicated questions into simpler, sequential steps, guiding the LLM through a logical reasoning process.\n\nBy prompting the model to “think through the problem step-by-step,” you encourage it to provide more detailed and well-reasoned responses, which can be particularly effective for handling multi-step or open-ended queries.\n\nPrompts may not transfer across models\n\nRecognize that prompts often do not transfer seamlessly across different language models. Each model has its own unique characteristics where a prompt that works well for one model may not be as effective for another.\n\nExperiment with different prompt formats and lengths, refer to online guides (such as OpenAI Cookbook or Anthropic cookbook), and be prepared to adapt and refine your prompts when switching between models.\n\nLLM\n\nThe generation component of the RAG chain takes the augmented prompt template from the previous step and passes it to a LLM. When selecting and optimizing an LLM for the generation component of a RAG chain, consider the following factors, which are equally applicable to any other steps that involve LLM calls:\n\nExperiment with different off-the-shelf models.\n\nEach model has its own unique properties, strengths, and weaknesses. Some models may have a better understanding of certain domains or perform better on specific tasks.\n\nAs mentioned prior, keep in mind that the choice of model may also influence the prompt engineering process, as different models may respond differently to the same prompts.\n\nIf there are multiple steps in your chain that require an LLM, such as calls for query understanding in addition to the generation step, consider using different models for different steps. More expensive, general-purpose models may be overkill for tasks like determining the intent of a user query.\n\nStart small and scale up as needed.\n\nWhile it may be tempting to immediately reach for the most powerful and capable models available (e.g., GPT-4, Claude), it’s often more efficient to start with smaller, more lightweight models.\n\nIn many cases, smaller open-source alternatives like Llama 3 or DBRX can provide satisfactory results at a lower cost and with faster inference times. These models can be particularly effective for tasks that don’t require highly complex reasoning or extensive world knowledge.\n\nAs you develop and refine your RAG chain, continuously assess the performance and limitations of your chosen model. If you find that the model struggles with certain types of queries or fails to provide sufficiently detailed or accurate responses, consider scaling up to a more capable model.\n\nMonitor the impact of changing models on key metrics such as response quality, latency, and cost to ensure that you’re striking the right balance for the requirements of your specific use case.\n\nOptimize model parameters\n\nExperiment with different parameter settings to find the optimal balance between response quality, diversity, and coherence. For example, adjusting the temperature can control the randomness of the generated text, while max_tokens can limit the response length.\n\nBe aware that the optimal parameter settings may vary depending on the specific task, prompt, and desired output style. Iteratively test and refine these settings based on evaluation of the generated responses.\n\nTask-specific fine-tuning\n\nAs you refine performance, consider fine-tuning smaller models for specific sub-tasks within your RAG chain, such as query understanding.\n\nBy training specialized models for individual tasks with the RAG chain, you can potentially improve the overall performance, reduce latency, and lower inference costs compared to using a single large model for all tasks.\n\nContinued pre-training\n\nIf your RAG application deals with a specialized domain or requires knowledge that is not well-represented in the pre-trained LLM, consider performing continued pre-training (CPT) on domain-specific data.\n\nContinued pre-training can improve a model’s understanding of specific terminology or concepts unique to your domain. In turn this can reduce the need for extensive prompt engineering or few-shot examples.\n\nPost-processing and guardrails\n\nAfter the LLM generates a response, it is often necessary to apply post-processing techniques or guardrails to ensure that the output meets the desired format, style, and content requirements. This final step (or multiple steps) in the chain can help maintain consistency and quality across the generated responses. If you are implementing post-processing and guardrails, consider some of the following:\n\nEnforcing output format\n\nDepending on your use case, you may require the generated responses to adhere to a specific format, such as a structured template or a particular file type (such as JSON, HTML, Markdown, and so on).\n\nIf structured output is required, libraries such as Instructor or Outlines provide good starting points to implement this kind of validation step.\n\nWhen developing, take time to ensure that the post-processing step is flexible enough to handle variations in the generated responses while maintaining the required format.\n\nMaintaining style consistency\n\nIf your RAG application has specific style guidelines or tone requirements (e.g., formal vs. casual, concise vs. detailed), a post-processing step can both check and enforce these style attributes across generated responses.\n\nContent filters and safety guardrails\n\nDepending on the nature of your RAG application and the potential risks associated with generated content, it may be important to implement content filters or safety guardrails to prevent the output of inappropriate, offensive, or harmful information.\n\nConsider using models like Llama Guard or APIs specifically designed for content moderation and safety, such as OpenAI’s moderation API, to implement safety guardrails.\n\nHandling hallucinations\n\nDefending against hallucinations can also be implemented as a post-processing step. This may involve cross-referencing the generated output with retrieved documents, or using additional LLMs to validate the factual accuracy of the response.\n\nDevelop fallback mechanisms to handle cases where the generated response fails to meet the factual accuracy requirements, such as generating alternative responses or providing disclaimers to the user.\n\nError handling\n\nWith any post-processing steps, implement mechanisms to gracefully deal with cases where the step encounters an issue or fails to generate a satisfactory response. This could involve generating a default response, or escalating the issue to a human operator for manual review.\n\n< Previous: Improve data pipeline quality\n\nNext: Evaluate RAG app quality >\n\nWas this article helpful?\n\n© Databricks 2025.

An evaluation set is a curated, representative set of queries, along with ground-truth answers and (optionally) the correct supporting documents that should be retrieved. Human input is crucial in this process, as it ensures that the evaluation set accurately reflects the expectations and requirements of the end-users.\n\nCurating human labels can be a time-consuming process. You can get started by creating an evaluation set that only includes questions, and add the ground truth responses over time. Mosaic AI Agent Evaluation can assess your chain’s quality without ground truth, although, if ground truth is available, it computes additional metrics such as answer correctness.\n\nElements of a good evaluation set\n\nA good evaluation set has the following characteristics:\n\nRepresentative: Accurately reflects the variety of requests the application will encounter in production.\n\nChallenging: The set should include difficult and diverse cases to effectively test the model’s capabilities. Ideally, it includes adversarial examples such as questions attempting prompt injection or questions attempting to generate inappropriate responses from LLM.\n\nContinually updated: The set must be periodically updated to reflect how the application is used in production, the changing nature of the indexed data, and any changes to the application requirements.\n\nDatabricks recommends at least 30 questions in your evaluation set, and ideally 100 - 200. The best evaluation sets will grow over time to contain 1,000s of questions.\n\nTraining, testing, and validation sets\n\nTo avoid overfitting, Databricks recommends splitting your evaluation set into training, test, and validation sets:\n\nTraining set: ~70% of the questions. Used for an initial pass to evaluate every experiment to identify the highest potential ones.\n\nTest set: ~20% of the questions.

Unstructured data refers to data without a specific structure or organization, such as PDF documents that might include text and images, or multimedia content such as audio or videos.\n\nUnstructured data lacks a predefined data model or schema, making it impossible to query on the basis of structure and metadata alone. As a result, unstructured data requires techniques that can understand and extract semantic meaning from raw text, images, audio, or other content.\n\nDuring data preparation, the RAG application data pipeline takes raw unstructured data and transforms it into discrete chunks that can be queried based on their relevance to a user’s query. The key steps in data preprocessing are outlined below. Each step has a variety of knobs that can be tuned - for a deeper dive discussion on these knobs, refer to the Improve RAG application quality.\n\nPrepare unstructured data for retrieval\n\nIn the remainder of this section, we describe the process of preparing unstructured data for retrieval using semantic search. Semantic search understands the contextual meaning and intent of a user query to provide more relevant search results.\n\nSemantic search is one of several approaches that can be taken when implementing the retrieval component of a RAG application over unstructured data. These docs cover alternate retrieval strategies in the retrieval knobs section.\n\nSteps of a RAG application data pipeline\n\nThe following are the typical steps of a data pipeline in a RAG application using unstructured data:\n\nParse the raw documents: The initial step involves transforming raw data into a usable format. This can include extracting text, tables, and images from a collection of PDFs or employing optical character recognition (OCR) techniques to extract text from images.\n\nExtract document metadata (optional): In some cases, extracting and using document metadata, such as document titles, page numbers, URLs, or other information can help the retrieval step more precisely query the correct data.\n\nChunk documents: To ensure the parsed documents can fit into the embedding model and the LLM’s context window, we break the parsed documents into smaller, discrete chunks. Retrieving these focused chunks, rather than entire documents, gives the LLM more targeted context from which to generate its responses.\n\nEmbedding chunks: In a RAG application that uses semantic search, a special type of language model called an embedding model transforms each of the chunks from the previous step into numeric vectors, or lists of numbers, that encapsulate the meaning of each piece of content. Crucially, these vectors represent the semantic meaning of the text, not just surface-level keywords. This enables searching based on meaning rather than literal text matches.\n\nIndex chunks in a vector database: The final step is to load the vector representations of the chunks, along with the chunk’s text, into a vector database. A vector database is a specialized type of database designed to efficiently store and search for vector data like embeddings. To maintain performance with a large number of chunks, vector databases commonly include a vector index that uses various algorithms to organize and map the vector embeddings in a way that optimizes search efficiency. At query time, a user’s request is embedded into a vector, and the database leverages the vector index to find the most similar chunk vectors, returning the corresponding original text chunks.\n\nThe process of computing similarity can be computationally expensive. Vector indexes, such as Databricks Vector Search, speed this process up by providing a mechanism for efﬁciently organizing and navigating embeddings, often via sophisticated approximation methods. This enables rapid ranking of the most relevant results without comparing each embedding to the user’s query individually.\n\nEach step in the data pipeline involves engineering decisions that impact the RAG application’s quality. For example, choosing the right chunk size in step 3 ensures the LLM receives specific yet contextualized information, while selecting an appropriate embedding model in step 4 determines the accuracy of the chunks returned during retrieval.\n\nThis data preparation process is referred to as offline data preparation, as it occurs before the system answers queries, unlike the online steps triggered when a user submits a query.\n\n< Previous: RAG fundamentals\n\nNext: RAG chain for inference >\n\nWas this article helpful?\n\n© Databricks 2025.

Technically, evaluation happens during development and monitoring happens once the application is deployed to production, but the fundamental components are similar.\n\nRAG over unstructured data is a complex system with many components that impact the application’s quality. Adjusting any single element can have cascading effects on the others. For instance, data formatting changes can influence the retrieved chunks and the LLM’s ability to generate relevant responses. Therefore, it’s crucial to evaluate each of the application’s components in addition to the application as a whole in order to iteratively refine it based on those assessments.\n\nEvaluation & monitoring: Classical ML vs. generative AI\n\nEvaluation and monitoring of Generative AI applications, including RAG, differs from classical machine learning in several ways:\n\nTopic\n\n\t\n\nClassical ML\n\n\t\n\nGenerative AI\n\n\n\n\nMetrics\n\n\t\n\nMetrics evaluate the inputs and outputs of the component, for example, feature drift, precision,recall, latency, and so on. Since there is only one component, overall metrics == component metrics.\n\n\t\n\nComponent metrics evaluate the inputs and outputs of each component, for example precision @ K, nDCG, latency, toxicity, and so on. Compound metrics evaluate how multiple components interact: Faithfulness measures the generator’s adherence to the knowledge from a retriever that requires the chain input, chain output, and output of the internal retriever. Overall metrics evaluate the overall input and output of the system, for example, answer correctness and latency.\n\n\n\n\nEvaluation\n\n\t\n\nAnswer is deterministically “right” or “wrong.” Deterministic metrics work.\n\n\t\n\nAnswer is “right” or “wrong” but: &bull; There are many right answers (non-deterministic). &bull; Some right answers are more right. You need: &bull; Human feedback to be confident. &bull; LLM-judged metrics to scale evaluation.\n\n\n\t\t\nComponents of evaluation and monitoring\n\nEffectively evaluating and monitoring RAG application quality, cost, and latency requires several components:\n\nEvaluation set: To rigorously evaluate your RAG application, you need a curated set of evaluation queries (and ideally outputs) that are representative of the application’s intended use. These evaluation examples should be challenging, diverse, and updated to reflect changing usage and requirements.\n\nMetric definitions: You can’t manage what you don’t measure. To improve RAG quality, it is essential to define what quality means for your use case. Depending on the application, important metrics might include response accuracy, latency, cost, or ratings from key stakeholders. You’ll need metrics that measure each component, how the components interact with each other, and the overall system.\n\nLLM judges: Given the open-ended nature of LLM responses, it is not feasible to read every single response each time you evaluate to determine if the output is correct. Using an additional, different LLM to review outputs can help scale your evaluation and compute additional metrics such as the groundedness of a response to thousands of tokens of context, that would be infeasible for human raters to effectively asses at scale.\n\nEvaluation harness: During development, an evaluation harness helps you quickly execute your application for every record in your evaluation set and then run each output through your LLM judges and metric computations. This is particularly challenging since this step “blocks” your inner dev loop, so speed is of the utmost importance. A good evaluation harness parallelizes this work as much as possible, often spinning up additional infrastructure such as more LLM capacity to do so.\n\nStakeholder-facing UI: As a developer, you may not be a domain expert in the content of the application you are developing. To collect feedback from human experts who can assess your application quality, you need an interface that allows them to interact with the application and provide detailed feedback.\n\nProduction trace logging: Once in production, you need to evaluate a significantly higher quantity of requests/responses and how each response was generated. For example, you need to know if the root cause of a low-quality answer is due to the retrieval step or a hallucination. Your production logging must track the inputs, outputs, and intermediate steps such as document retrieval to enable ongoing monitoring and early detection and diagnosis of issues that arise in production.\n\nThese docs cover evaluation in much more detail in Evaluate RAG quality.\n\n< Previous: RAG chain for inference\n\nNext: RAG app governance & LLMOps >\n\n© Databricks 2025.

Once the data has been processed by the data pipeline, it is suitable for use in the RAG application. The series, or chain of steps that are invoked at inference time is commonly referred to as the RAG chain.\n\n(Optional) User query preprocessing: In some cases, the user’s query is preprocessed to make it more suitable for querying the vector database. This can involve formatting the query within a template, using another model to rewrite the request, or extracting keywords to aid retrieval. The output of this step is a retrieval query which will be used in the subsequent retrieval step.\n\nRetrieval: To retrieve supporting information from the vector database, the retrieval query is translated into an embedding using the same embedding model that was used to embed the document chunks during data preparation. These embeddings enable comparison of the semantic similarity between the retrieval query and the unstructured text chunks, using measures like cosine similarity. Next, chunks are retrieved from the vector database and ranked based on how similar they are to the embedded request. The top (most similar) results are returned.\n\nPrompt augmentation: The prompt that will be sent to the LLM is formed by augmenting the user’s query with the retrieved context, in a template that instructs the model how to use each component, often with additional instructions to control the response format. The process of iterating on the right prompt template to use is referred to as prompt engineering.\n\nLLM Generation: The LLM takes the augmented prompt, which includes the user’s query and retrieved supporting data, as input. It then generates a response that is grounded on the additional context.\n\n(Optional) Post-processing: The LLM’s response may be processed further to apply additional business logic, add citations, or otherwise refine the generated text based on predefined rules or constraints.\n\nAs with the RAG application data pipeline, there are many consequential engineering decisions that can affect the quality of the RAG chain. For example, determining how many chunks to retrieve in step 2 and how to combine them with the user’s query in step 3 can significantly impact the model’s ability to generate quality responses.\n\nThroughout the chain, various guardrails may be applied to ensure compliance with enterprise policies. This might involve filtering for appropriate requests, checking user permissions before accessing data sources, and applying content moderation techniques to the generated responses.\n\n< Previous: RAG data pipeline\n\nNext: Evaluate & monitor RAG apps >\n\n© Databricks 2025.

If you followed Step 4. Evaluate the POC’s quality, the results are available in MLflow.\n\nAll requirements from previous steps.\n\nOverview\n\nThe most likely root causes of quality issues are the retrieval and generation steps. To determine where to focus first, use the output of the Mosaic AI Agent Evaluation LLM judges that you ran in the previous step to identify the most frequent root cause that impacts your app’s quality.\n\nEach row your evaluation set is tagged as follows:\n\nOverall assessment: Pass or fail.\n\nRoot cause: Improve Retrieval or Improve Generation.\n\nRoot cause rationale: A brief description of why the root cause was selected.\n\nInstructions\n\nThe approach depends on if your evaluation set contains the ground-truth responses to your questions. These responses are stored in expected_response. If you have expected_response available, use the table Root cause analysis if ground truth is available. Otherwise, use the table Root cause analysis if ground truth is not available.\n\nOpen the B_quality_iteration/01_root_cause_quality_issues notebook.\n\nRun the cells that are relevant to your use case e.g., if you do or don’t have expected_response\n\nReview the output tables to determine the most frequent root cause in your application\n\nFor each root cause, follow the steps below to further debug and identify potential fixes:\n\nDebug retrieval quality\n\nDebug generation quality\n\nRoot cause analysis if ground truth is available\n\nNote\n\nIf you have human labeled ground-truth for which document should be retrieved for each question, you can optionally substitute retrieval/llm_judged/chunk_relevance/precision/average with the score for retrieval/ground_truth/document_recall/average.\n\nChunk relevance precision\n\n\t\n\nGroundedness\n\n\t\n\nCorrectness\n\n\t\n\nRelevance to query\n\n\t\n\nIssue summary\n\n\t\n\nRoot cause\n\n\t\n\nOverall rating\n\n\n\n\n<50%\n\n\t\n\nFail\n\n\t\n\nFail\n\n\t\n\nFail\n\n\t\n\nRetrieval is poor.\n\n\t\n\nImprove Retrieval\n\n\t\n\nFail\n\n\n\n\n<50%\n\n\t\n\nFail\n\n\t\n\nFail\n\n\t\n\nPass\n\n\t\n\nLLM generates relevant response, but retrieval is poor.

Deploy & monitor\nStep 7. Deploy & monitor\n\nOctober 29, 2024\n\nThis article provides high level guidance on how to deploy and monitor your proof of concept RAG application.\n\nNow that you have built your RAG POC, evaluated it, and improved its quality, it’s time to deploy your RAG application to production. It is important to note that this does not mean that you are done monitoring performance and collecting feedback. Iterating on quality remains extremely important, even after deployment, as both data and usage patterns can change over time.\n\nWith Databricks, your chain is ready to deploy as-is using Mosaic AI Agent Serving. See Deploy an agent for generative AI application for instructions.\n\nDeployment\n\nProper deployment is crucial for ensuring the smooth operation and success of your RAG solution. The following are critical considerations to keep in mind when deploying your RAG application:\n\nIdentify key integration points\n\nAnalyze your existing systems and workflows to determine where and how your RAG solution should integrate.\n\nAssess if certain integrations are more critical or complex than others, and prioritize accordingly.\n\nImplement versioning and scalability\n\nSet up a versioning system for your models to enable easy tracking and rollbacks.\n\nDesign your deployment architecture to handle increasing loads and scale efficiently, leveraging tools like Databricks Model Serving.\n\nEnsure security and access control\n\nFollow security best practices when deploying your RAG solution, such as securing endpoints and protecting sensitive data.\n\nImplement proper access control mechanisms to ensure only authorized users can interact with your RAG solution.\n\nMonitoring\n\nOnce you have deployed your RAG application, it is essential to monitor its performance. Real-world usage can reveal issues that may not have been apparent during earlier testing and evaluation. Furthermore, changing data and requirements can impact application performance over time. The following are important monitoring practices to follow:\n\nEstablish monitoring metrics and logging\n\nDefine key performance metrics to monitor the health and effectiveness of your RAG solution, such as accuracy, response times, and resource utilization.\n\nImplement comprehensive logging to capture important events, errors, and user interactions for debugging and improvement purposes.\n\nSet up alerts and feedback channels\n\nConfigure alerts to notify you of anomalies or critical issues, allowing for proactive problem resolution.\n\nProvide channels for users to give feedback on the RAG solution and regularly review and address this feedback.\n\nContinuously monitor and improve\n\nContinuously analyze the performance of your RAG solution using the established monitoring metrics.\n\nUse insights gained from monitoring to drive iterative improvements and optimizations to your RAG solution.\n\nConduct regular health checks\n\nSchedule regular health checks to proactively identify and address any potential issues before they impact users.\n\nAssess if certain components or integrations are more prone to issues and require closer monitoring.\n\n< Previous: Step 6.1.

The evaluation results are used by the next step to identify the root cause of any quality issues.\n\nEvaluation is done using Mosaic AI Agent Evaluation and looks comprehensively across all aspects of quality, cost, and latency that are outlined in the metrics section of this tutorial.\n\nThe aggregated metrics and evaluation of each question in the evaluation set are logged to MLflow. For details, see Evaluation outputs.\n\nRequirements\n\nEvaluation set is available.\n\nAll requirements from previous steps.\n\nInstructions\n\nOpen the 05_evaluate_poc_quality notebook in your chosen POC directory and click Run all.\n\nInspect the results of evaluation in the notebook or using MLflow. If the results meet your requirements for quality, you can skip directly to Deploy and monitor. Because the POC application is built on Databricks, it is ready to be deployed to a scalable, production-ready REST API.\n\nNext step\n\nUsing this baseline evaluation of the POC’s quality, identify the root causes of any quality issues and iteratively fix those issues to improve the app. See Step 5.

Time varies based on the quality of the responses provided by your stakeholders. If the responses are messy or contain lots of irrelevant queries, you will need to spend more time filtering and cleaning the data.\n\nOverview and expected outcome\n\nThis step will bootstrap an evaluation set with the feedback that stakeholders have provided by using the Review App. Note that you can bootstrap an evaluation set with just questions, so even if your stakeholders only chatted with the app vs. providing feedback, you can follow this step.\n\nFor the schema of the Agent Evaluation evaluation set, see Agent Evaluation input schema. The fields in this schema are referenced in the rest of this section.\n\nAt the end of this step, you will have an Evaluation Set that contains the following:\n\nRequests with a thumbs-up 👍:\n\nrequest: as entered by the user.\n\nexpected_response: Response as edited by the user. If the user did not edit the response, the response generated by the model.\n\nRequests with a thumbs-down 👎:\n\nrequest: as entered by the user.\n\nexpected_response: Response as edited by the user. If the user did not edit the response, the response is null.\n\nRequests with no feedback (no thumbs-up 👍 or thumbs-down 👎)\n\nrequest: as entered by the user.\n\nFor all requests, if the user selects thumbs-up 👍 for a chunk from the retrieved_context, the doc_uri of that chunk is included in expected_retrieved_context for the question.\n\nImportant\n\nDatabricks recommends that your evaluation set contain at least 30 questions to get started. Read the evaluation set deep dive to learn more about what a “good” evaluation set is.\n\nRequirements\n\nStakeholders have used your POC and provided feedback.\n\nAll requirements from previous steps.\n\nInstructions\n\nOpen the 04_create_evaluation_set notebook and click Run all.\n\nInspect the evaluation set to understand the data that is included. You need to validate that your evaluation set contains a representative and challenging set of questions. Adjust the evaluation set as required.\n\nBy default, your evaluation set is saved to the Delta table configured in EVALUATION_SET_FQN in the 00_global_config notebook.\n\nNext step\n\nNow that you have an evaluation set, use it to evaluate the POC app’s quality, cost, and latency.

Deploy POC to collect stakeholder feedback\n\nDecember 30, 2024\n\nAt the end of this step, you will have deployed the Agent Evaluation Review App which allows your stakeholders to test and provide feedback on your POC. Detailed logs from your stakeholder’s usage and their feedback will flow to Delta Tables in your Lakehouse.\n\nRequirements\n\nComplete Step 1. Clone code repository and create compute steps\n\nData from Prerequisite: Gather requirements is available in your Lakehouse inside a Unity Catalog volume.\n\nSee the GitHub repository for the sample code in this section.\n\nProof of concept RAG application\n\nThe first step in evaluation-driven development is to build a proof of concept (POC). A POC offers the following benefits:\n\nProvides a directional view on the feasibility of your use case with RAG\n\nAllows collecting initial feedback from stakeholders, which in turn enables you to create the first version of your Evaluation Set\n\nEstablishes a baseline measurement of quality to start to iterate from\n\nDatabricks recommends building your POC using the simplest RAG architecture and Databricks recommended defaults for each parameter.\n\nThis recommendation is because there are hundreds of possible combinations of parameters that you can tune within your RAG application. You can easily spend weeks tuning these, but if you do so before you can systematically evaluate your RAG, you end up in what is referred to as a POC doom loop–iterating on settings, but with no way to objectively know if you made an improvement—all while your stakeholders sit around impatiently waiting to review.\n\nThe POC templates in this tutorial are designed with quality iteration in mind. They are parameterized based on what the Databricks research team has shown are important to tune in order to improve RAG quality. These templates are not “3 lines of code that magically make a RAG”, but are a well-structured RAG application that can be tuned for quality in the following steps of an evaluation-driven development workflow.\n\nThis enables you to quickly deploy a POC, but transition quickly to quality iteration without needing to rewrite your code.\n\nBelow is the technical architecture of the POC application:\n\nNote\n\nBy default, the POC uses the open source models available on Mosaic AI Foundation Model Serving. However, because the POC uses Mosaic AI Model Serving, which supports any foundation model, using a different model is easy - simply configure that model in Model Serving and then replace the embedding_endpoint_name and llm_endpoint_name in the 00_config notebook.\n\nFollow Provisioned throughput Foundation Model APIs for other open source models available in the Databricks Marketplace.\n\nFollow Create_OpenAI_External_Model notebook or External models in Mosaic AI Model Serving for supported third party hosted models such as Azure OpenAI, OpenAI, Cohere, Anthropic and Google Gemini.\n\nSteps to deploy a POC to collect feedback\n\nThe following steps show how to run and deploy a POC generative AI application. After you deploy you get a URL to the review app that you can share with stakeholders to collect feedback.\n\nOpen the POC code folder within A_POC_app based on your type of data:\n\nFor PDF files, use the pdf_uc_volume.\n\nFor Powerpoint files, use the pptx_uc_volume.\n\nFor DOCX files, use the docx_uc_volume.\n\nJSON files with text, markdown, HTML content and metadata, use the json_uc_volume\n\nIf your data doesn’t meet one of the above requirements, you can customize the parsing function (parser_udf) within 02_poc_data_pipeline in the above POC directories to work with your file types.\n\nInside the POC folder, you see the following notebooks:\n\nNote\n\nThese notebooks are relative to the specific POC you’ve chosen. For example, if you see a reference to 00_config and you’ve chosen pdf_uc_volume, you can find the relevant 00_config notebook at A_POC_app/pdf_uc_volume/00_config.\n\nOptionally, review the default parameters.\n\nOpen the 00_config notebook within the POC directory you chose above to view the POC’s applications default parameters for the data pipeline and RAG chain.\n\nImportant\n\nThe Databricks recommended default parameters are not intended to be perfect, but are a place to start. The next steps of this workflow guide you through iterating on these parameters.\n\nValidate the configuration.\n\nRun the 01_validate_config to check that your configuration is valid and all resources are available. The rag_chain_config.yaml file appears in your directory, which is used to deploy the application.\n\nRun the data pipeline.\n\nThe POC data pipeline is a Databricks notebook based on Apache Spark. Open the 02_poc_data_pipeline notebook and press Run All to run the pipeline. The pipeline does the following:\n\nLoads the raw documents from the UC Volume\n\nParses each document, saving the results to a Delta Table\n\nChunks each document, saving the results to a Delta Table\n\nEmbeds the documents and create a Vector Index using Mosaic AI Vector Search\n\nMetadata, like output tables and configuration, about the data pipeline are logged to MLflow:\n\nYou can inspect the outputs by looking for links to the Delta Tables or vector indexes output near the bottom of the notebook:\n\nCopy\nBash\nVector index: https://<your-workspace-url>.databricks.com/explore/data/<uc-catalog>/<uc-schema>/<app-name>_poc_chunked_docs_gold_index\n\nOutput tables:\n\nBronze Delta Table w/ raw files: https://<your-workspace-url>.databricks.com/explore/data/<uc-catalog>/<uc-schema>/<app-name>__poc_raw_files_bronze\nSilver Delta Table w/ parsed files: https://<your-workspace-url>.databricks.com/explore/data/<uc-catalog>/<uc-schema>/<app-name>__poc_parsed_docs_silver\nGold Delta Table w/ chunked files: https://<your-workspace-url>.databricks.com/explore/data/<uc-catalog>/<uc-schema>/<app-name>__poc_chunked_docs_gold\n\n\nDeploy the POC chain to the Review App.\n\nThe default POC chain is a multi-turn conversation RAG chain built using LangChain.\n\nNote\n\nThe POC Chain uses MLflow code-based logging. To understand more about code-based logging, see Log and register AI agents.\n\nOpen the 03_deploy_poc_to_review_app notebook\n\nRun each cell of the notebook.\n\nThe MLflow trace shows you how the POC application works. Adjust the input question to one that is relevant to your use case, and re-run the cell to “vibe check” the application.\n\nModify the default instructions to be relevant to your use case. These are displayed in the Review App.\n\nCopy\nPython\n   instructions_to_reviewer = f\"\"\"## Instructions for Testing the {RAG_APP_NAME}'s Initial Proof of Concept (PoC)\n\n   Your inputs are invaluable for the development team. By providing detailed feedback and corrections, you help us fix issues and improve the overall quality of the application. We rely on your expertise to identify any gaps or areas needing enhancement.\n\n   1. **Variety of Questions**:\n      - Please try a wide range of questions that you anticipate the end users of the application will ask. This helps us ensure the application can handle the expected queries effectively.\n\n   2. **Feedback on Answers**:\n      - After asking each question, use the feedback widgets provided to review the answer given by the application.\n      - If you think the answer is incorrect or could be improved, please use \"Edit Answer\" to correct it. Your corrections will enable our team to refine the application's accuracy.\n\n   3. **Review of Returned Documents**:\n      - Carefully review each document that the system returns in response to your question.\n      - Use the thumbs up/down feature to indicate whether the document was relevant to the question asked. A thumbs up signifies relevance, while a thumbs down indicates the document was not useful.\n\n   Thank you for your time and effort in testing {RAG_APP_NAME}. Your contributions are essential to delivering a high-quality product to our end users.\"\"\"\n\n   print(instructions_to_reviewer)\n\n\nRun the deployment cell to get a link to the Review App.\n\nCopy\nBash\nReview App URL: https://<your-workspace-url>.databricks.com/ml/review/<uc-catalog>.<uc-schema>.<uc-model-name>/<uc-model-version>\n\n\nGrant individual users permissions to access the Review App.\n\nYou can grant access to non-Databricks users by following the steps in Set up permissions to use the review app.\n\nTest the Review App by asking a few questions yourself and providing feedback.\n\nNote\n\nMLflow Traces and the user’s feedback from the Review App appear in Delta Tables in the catalog schema you have configured. Logs can take up to 2 hours to appear in these Delta Tables.\n\nShare the Review App with stakeholders\n\nYou can now share your POC RAG application with your stakeholders to get their feedback.\n\nImportant\n\nDatabricks suggests distributing your POC to at least three stakeholders and having them each ask 10 - 20 questions. It is important to have multiple stakeholders test your POC so you can have a diverse set of perspectives to include in your evaluation set.\n\nNext step\n\nContinue with Step 3.

These requirements serve two primary purposes. Firstly, they help determine whether RAG is the most suitable approach for the given use case. If RAG is indeed a good fit, these requirements guide solution design, implementation, and evaluation decisions. Investing time at the outset of a project to gather detailed requirements can prevent significant challenges and setbacks later in the development process, and ensures that the resulting solution meets the needs of end-users and stakeholders. Well-defined requirements provide the foundation for the subsequent stages of the development lifecycle we’ll walk through.\n\nSee the GitHub repository for the sample code in this section. You can also use the repository code as a template with which to create your own AI applications.\n\nIs the use case a good fit for RAG?\n\nThe first thing you need to establish is whether RAG is even the right approach for your use case. Given the hype around RAG, it’s tempting to view it as a possible solution for any problem. However, there are nuances as to when RAG is suitable versus not.\n\nRAG is a good fit when:\n\nReasoning over retrieved information (both unstructured and structured) that doesn’t entirely fit within the LLM’s context window\n\nSynthesizing information from multiple sources (for example, generating a summary of key points from different articles on a topic)\n\nDynamic retrieval based on a user query is necessary (for example, given a user query, determine what data source to retrieve from)\n\nThe use case requires generating novel content based on retrieved information (for example, answering questions, providing explanations, offering recommendations)\n\nRAG may not be the best fit when:\n\nThe task does not require query-specific retrieval. For example, generating call transcript summaries; even if individual transcripts are provided as context in the LLM prompt, the retrieved information remains the same for each summary.\n\nThe entire set of information to retrieve can fit within the LLM’s context window\n\nExtremely low-latency responses are required (for example, when responses are required in milliseconds)\n\nSimple rule-based or templated responses are sufficient (for example, a customer support chatbot that provides predefined answers based on keywords)\n\nRequirements to discover\n\nAfter you have established that RAG is a good fit for your use case, consider the following questions to capture concrete requirements. The requirements are prioritized as follows:\n\n🟢 P0: Must define this requirement before starting your POC.\n\n🟡 P1: Must define before going to production, but can iteratively refine during the POC.\n\n⚪ P2: Nice to have requirement.\n\nThis is not an exhaustive list of questions. However, it should provide a solid foundation for capturing the key requirements for your RAG solution.\n\nUser experience\n\nDefine how users will interact with the RAG system and what kind of responses are expected\n\n🟢 [P0] What will a typical request to the RAG chain look like? Ask stakeholders for examples of potential user queries.\n\n🟢 [P0] What kind of responses will users expect (short answers, long-form explanations, a combination, or something else)?\n\n🟡 [P1] How will users interact with the system? Through a chat interface, search bar, or some other modality?\n\n🟡 [P1] hat tone or style should generated responses take? (formal, conversational, technical?)\n\n🟡 [P1] How should the application handle ambiguous, incomplete, or irrelevant queries? Should any form of feedback or guidance be provided in such cases?\n\n⚪ [P2] Are there specific formatting or presentation requirements for the generated output? Should the output include any metadata in addition to the chain’s response?\n\nData\n\nDetermine the nature, source(s), and quality of the data that will be used in the RAG solution.\n\n🟢 [P0] What are the available sources to use?\n\nFor each data source:\n\n🟢 [P0] Is data structured or unstructured?\n\n🟢 [P0] What is the source format of the retrieval data (e.g., PDFs, documentation with images/tables, structured API responses)?\n\n🟢 [P0] Where does that data reside?\n\n🟢 [P0] How much data is available?\n\n🟡 [P1] How frequently is the data updated? How should those updates be handled?\n\n🟡 [P1] Are there any known data quality issues or inconsistencies for each data source?\n\nConsider creating an inventory table to consolidate this information, for example:\n\nData source\n\n\t\n\nSource\n\n\t\n\nFile type(s)\n\n\t\n\nSize\n\n\t\n\nUpdate frequency\n\n\n\n\nData source 1\n\n\t\n\nUnity Catalog volume\n\n\t\n\nJSON\n\n\t\n\n10GB\n\n\t\n\nDaily\n\n\n\n\nData source 2\n\n\t\n\nPublic API\n\n\t\n\nXML\n\n\t\n\nNA (API)\n\n\t\n\nReal-time\n\n\n\n\nData source 3\n\n\t\n\nSharePoint\n\n\t\n\nPDF, .docx\n\n\t\n\n500MB\n\n\t\n\nMonthly\n\nPerformance constraints\n\nCapture performance and resource requirements for the RAG application.\n\n🟡 [P1] What is the maximum acceptable latency for generating the responses?\n\n🟡 [P1] What is the maximum acceptable time to first token?\n\n🟡 [P1] If the output is being streamed, is higher total latency acceptable?\n\n🟡 [P1] Are there any cost limitations on compute resources available for inference?\n\n🟡 [P1] What are the expected usage patterns and peak loads?\n\n🟡 [P1] How many concurrent users or requests should the system be able to handle? Databricks natively handles such scalability requirements, through the ability to scale automatically with Model Serving.\n\nEvaluation\n\nEstablish how the RAG solution will be evaluated and improved over time.\n\n🟢 [P0] What is the business goal / KPI you want to impact? What is the baseline value and what is the target?\n\n🟢 [P0] Which users or stakeholders will provide initial and ongoing feedback?\n\n🟢 [P0] What metrics should be used to assess the quality of generated responses? Mosaic AI Agent Evaluation provides a recommended set of metrics to use.\n\n🟡 [P1] What is the set of questions the RAG app must be good at to go to production?\n\n🟡 [P1] Does an [evaluation set] exist? Is it possible to get an evaluation set of user queries, along with ground-truth answers and (optionally) the correct supporting documents that should be retrieved?\n\n🟡 [P1] How will user feedback be collected and incorporated into the system?\n\nSecurity\n\nIdentify any security and privacy considerations.\n\n🟢 [P0] Are there sensitive/confidential data that needs to be handled with care?\n\n🟡 [P1] Do access controls need to be implemented in the solution (for example, a given user can only retrieve from a restricted set of documents)?\n\nDeployment\n\nUnderstanding how the RAG solution will be integrated, deployed, and maintained.\n\n🟡 How should the RAG solution integrate with existing systems and workflows?\n\n🟡 How should the model be deployed, scaled, and versioned? This tutorial covers how the end-to-end lifecycle can be handled on Databricks using MLflow, Unity Catalog, Agent SDK, and Model Serving.\n\nExample\n\nAs an example, consider how these questions apply to this example RAG application used by a Databricks customer support team:\n\nArea\n\n\t\n\nConsiderations\n\n\t\n\nRequirements\n\n\n\n\nUser experience\n\n\t\n\nInteraction modality.\n\nTypical user query examples.\n\nExpected response format and style.\n\nHandling ambiguous or irrelevant queries.\n\n\t\n\nChat interface integrated with Slack.\n\nExample queries: “How do I reduce cluster startup time?” “What kind of support plan do I have?”\n\nClear, technical responses with code snippets and links to relevant documentation where appropriate.\n\nProvide contextual suggestions and escalate to support engineers when needed.\n\n\n\n\nData\n\n\t\n\nNumber and type of data sources.\n\nData format and location.\n\nData size and update frequency.\n\nData quality and consistency.\n\n\t\n\nThree data sources.\n\nCompany documentation (HTML, PDF).\n\nResolved support tickets (JSON).\n\nCommunity forum posts (Delta table).\n\nData stored in Unity Catalog and updated weekly.\n\nTotal data size: 5GB.\n\nConsistent data structure and quality maintained by dedicated docs and support teams.\n\n\n\n\nPerformance\n\n\t\n\nMaximum acceptable latency.\n\nCost constraints.\n\nExpected usage and concurrency.\n\n\t\n\nMaximum latency requirement.\n\nCost constraints.\n\nExpected peak load.\n\n\n\n\nEvaluation\n\n\t\n\nEvaluation dataset availability.\n\nQuality metrics.\n\nUser feedback collection.\n\n\t\n\nSubject matter experts from each product area help review outputs and adjust incorrect answers to create the evaluation dataset.\n\nBusiness KPIs.\n\nIncrease in support ticket resolution rate.\n\nDecrease in user time spent per support ticket.\n\nQuality metrics.\n\nLLM-judged answer correctness and relevance.\n\nLLM judges retrieval precision.\n\nUser upvote or downvote.\n\nFeedback collection.\n\nSlack will be instrumented to provide a thumbs up / down.\n\n\n\n\nSecurity\n\n\t\n\nSensitive data handling.\n\nAccess control requirements.\n\n\t\n\nNo sensitive customer data should be in the retrieval source.\n\nUser authentication through Databricks Community SSO.\n\n\n\n\nDeployment\n\n\t\n\nIntegration with existing systems.\n\nDeployment and versioning.\n\n\t\n\nIntegration with support ticket system.\n\nChain deployed as a Databricks Model Serving endpoint.\n\nNext step\n\nGet started with Step 1.

This workflow is based on the Mosaic Research team’s recommended best practices for building and evaluating high-quality RAG applications. Databricks recommends the following evaluation-driven workflow:\n\nDefine the requirements.\n\nCollect stakeholder feedback on a rapid proof of concept (POC).\n\nEvaluate the POC’s quality.\n\nIteratively diagnose and fix quality issues.\n\nDeploy to production.\n\nMonitor in production.\n\nThere are two core concepts in evaluation-driven development:\n\nMetrics: Defining what high-quality means.\n\nSimilar to how you set business goals each year, you need to define what high-quality means for your use case. Mosaic AI Agent Evaluation provides a suggested set of metrics to use, the most important of which is answer accuracy or correctness - is the RAG application providing the right answer?\n\nEvaluation set: Objectively measuring the metrics.\n\nTo objectively measure quality, you need an evaluation set, which contains questions with known-good answers validated by humans. This guide walks you through the process of developing and iteratively refining this evaluation set.\n\nAnchoring against metrics and an evaluation set provides the following benefits:\n\nYou can iteratively and confidently refine your application’s quality during development - no more guessing if a change resulted in an improvement.\n\nGetting alignment with business stakeholders on the readiness of the application for production becomes more straightforward when you can confidently state, “we know our application answers the most critical questions to our business correctly and doesn’t hallucinate.”\n\nFor a step-by-step walkthrough illustrating the evaluation-driven workflow, start with Prerequisite: Gather requirements.\n\n< Previous: Enable evaluation\n\nNext: Prerequisites >\n\n© Databricks 2025.

By incorporating this retrieved information, RAG enables the LLM to generate more accurate, higher-quality responses compared to not augmenting the prompt with additional context.\n\nFor example, suppose you are building a question-and-answer chatbot to help employees answer questions about your company’s proprietary documents. A standalone LLM won’t be able to accurately answer questions about the content of these documents if it was not specifically trained on them. The LLM might refuse to answer due to a lack of information or, even worse, it might generate an incorrect response.\n\nRAG addresses this issue by first retrieving relevant information from the company documents based on a user’s query, and then providing the retrieved information to the LLM as additional context. This allows the LLM to generate a more accurate response by drawing from the specific details found in the relevant documents. In essence, RAG enables the LLM to “consult” the retrieved information to formulate its answer.\n\nCore components of a RAG application\n\nA RAG application is an example of a compound AI system: It expands on the language capabilities of the model alone by combining it with other tools and procedures.\n\nWhen using a standalone LLM, a user submits a request, such as a question, to the LLM, and the LLM responds with an answer based solely on its training data.\n\nIn its most basic form, the following steps happen in a RAG application:\n\nRetrieval: The user’s request is used to query some outside source of information. This might mean querying a vector store, conducting a keyword search over some text, or querying a SQL database. The goal of the retrieval step is to obtain supporting data that helps the LLM provide a useful response.\n\nAugmentation: The supporting data from the retrieval step is combined with the user’s request, often using a template with additional formatting and instructions to the LLM, to create a prompt.\n\nGeneration: The resulting prompt is passed to the LLM, and the LLM generates a response to the user’s request.\n\nThis is a simplified overview of the RAG process, but it’s important to note that implementing a RAG application involves many complex tasks. Preprocessing source data to make it suitable for use in RAG, effectively retrieving data, formatting the augmented prompt, and evaluating the generated responses all require careful consideration and effort. These topics will be covered in greater detail in later sections of this guide.\n\nWhy use RAG?\n\nThe following table outlines the benefits of using RAG versus a stand-alone LLM:\n\nWith an LLM alone\n\n\t\n\nUsing LLMs with RAG\n\n\n\n\nNo proprietary knowledge: LLMs are generally trained on publicly available data, so they cannot accurately answer questions about a company’s internal or proprietary data.\n\n\t\n\nRAG applications can incorporate proprietary data: A RAG application can supply proprietary documents such as memos, emails, and design documents to an LLM, enabling it to answer questions about those documents.\n\n\n\n\nKnowledge isn’t updated in real time: LLMs do not have access to information about events that occurred after they were trained. For example, a standalone LLM cannot tell you anything about stock movements today.\n\n\t\n\nRAG applications can access real-time data: A RAG application can supply the LLM with timely information from an updated data source, allowing it to provide useful answers about events past its training cutoff date.\n\n\n\n\nLack of citations: LLMs cannot cite specific sources of information when responding, leaving the user unable to verify whether the response is factually correct or a hallucination.\n\n\t\n\nRAG can cite sources: When used as part of a RAG application, an LLM can be asked to cite its sources.\n\n\n\n\nLack of data access controls (ACLs): LLMs alone can’t reliably provide different answers to different users based on specific user permissions.\n\n\t\n\nRAG allows for data security/ACLs: The retrieval step can be designed to find only the information that the user has credentials to access, enabling a RAG application to selectively retrieve personal or proprietary information.\n\nTypes of RAG\n\nThe RAG architecture can work with two types of supporting data:\n\n\t\n\nStructured data\n\n\t\n\nUnstructured data\n\n\n\n\nDefinition\n\n\t\n\nTabular data arranged in rows and columns with a specific schema, for example, tables in a database.\n\n\t\n\nData without a specific structure or organization, for example, documents that include text and images or multimedia content such as audio or videos.\n\n\n\n\nExample data sources\n\n\t\n\nCustomer records in a BI or data warehouse system\n\nTransaction data from a SQL database\n\nData from application APIs (such as SAP, Salesforce, and so on)\n\n\t\n\nCustomer records in a BI or data warehouse system\n\nTransaction data from a SQL database\n\nData from application APIs (such as SAP, Salesforce, and so on)\n\nPDFs\n\nGoogle or Microsoft Office documents\n\nWikis\n\nImages\n\nVideos\n\nYour choice of data for RAG depends on your use case.

While there are countless others, the article focuses on the most important knobs that have the greatest impact on the quality of your RAG application. Databricks recommends starting with these knobs.\n\nTwo types of quality considerations\n\nFrom a conceptual point of view, it’s helpful to view RAG quality knobs through the lens of the two key types of quality issues:\n\nRetrieval quality: Are you retrieving the most relevant information for a given retrieval query?\n\nIt’s difficult to generate high-quality RAG output if the context provided to the LLM is missing important information or contains superfluous information.\n\nGeneration quality: Given the retrieved information and the original user query, is the LLM generating the most accurate, coherent, and helpful response possible?\n\nIssues here can manifest as hallucinations, inconsistent output, or failure to directly address the user query.\n\nRAG apps have two components that can be iterated on to address quality challenges: data pipeline and the chain. It’s tempting to assume a clean division between retrieval issues (simply update the data pipeline) and generation issues (update the RAG chain). However, the reality is more nuanced. Retrieval quality can be influenced by both the data pipeline (for example, parsing/chunking strategy, metadata strategy, embedding model) and the RAG chain (for example, user query transformation, number of chunks retrieved, re-ranking). Similarly, generation quality will invariably be impacted by poor retrieval (for example, irrelevant or missing information affecting model output).\n\nThis overlap underscores the need for a holistic approach to RAG quality improvement. By understanding which components to change across both the data pipeline and RAG chain, and how these changes affect the overall solution, you can make targeted updates to improve RAG output quality.\n\nData pipeline quality considerations\n\nKey considerations about the data pipeline:\n\nThe composition of the input data corpus.\n\nHow raw data is extracted and transformed into a usable format (for example, parsing a PDF document).\n\nHow documents are split into smaller chunks and how those chunks are formatted (for example, chunking strategy, and chunk size).\n\nThe metadata (like section title or document title) extracted about each document and/or chunk. How this metadata is included (or not included) in each chunk.\n\nThe embedding model used to convert text into vector representations for similarity search.\n\nRAG chain\n\nThe choice of LLM and its parameters (for example, temperature and max tokens).\n\nThe retrieval parameters (for example, the number of chunks or documents retrieved).\n\nThe retrieval approach (for example, keyword vs. hybrid vs. semantic search, rewriting the user’s query, transforming a user’s query into filters, or re-ranking).\n\nHow to format the prompt with the retrieved context to guide the LLM toward quality output.\n\n< Previous: RAG app governance & LLMOps\n\nNext: Improve data pipeline quality >\n\n© Databricks 2025.

Model invocation might fail, for example, if the generative model is temporarily unavailable. If this occurs, the output includes the following lines, where n is the total number of rows evaluated and k is the number of rows with an error:\n\nCopy\n**Evaluation completed**\n- k/n contain model errors\n\n\nThis error appears in the MLFlow UI when you view the details of a particular row of the evaluation set.\n\nYou can also view the error in the evaluation results DataFrame. In this case, you see rows in the evaluation results containing model_error_message. To view these errors, using the following code snippet:\n\nCopy\nPython\nresult = mlflow.evaluate(..., model=<your model>, model_type=\"databricks-agent\")\neval_results_df = result.tables['eval_results']\ndisplay(eval_results_df[eval_results_df['model_error_message'].notna()][['request', 'model_error_message']])\n\n\nIf the error is recoverable, you can re-run evaluation on just the failed rows:\n\nCopy\nPython\nresult = mlflow.evaluate(..., model_type=\"databricks-agent\")\neval_results_df = result.tables['eval_results']\n# Filter rows where 'model_error_message' is not null and select columns required for evaluation.\ninput_cols = ['request_id', 'request', 'expected_retrieved_context', 'expected_response']\nretry_df = eval_results_df.loc[\n    eval_results_df['model_error_message'].notna(),\n    [col for col in input_cols if col in eval_results_df.columns]\n]\nretry_result = mlflow.evaluate(\n    data=retry_df,\n    model=<your model>,\n    model_type=\"databricks-agent\"\n)\nretry_result_df = retry_result.tables['eval_results']\n\nmerged_results_df = eval_results_df.set_index('request_id').combine_first(\n    retry_result.tables['eval_results'].set_index('request_id')\n).reset_index()\n\n# Reorder the columns to match the original eval_results_df column order\nmerged_results_df = merged_results_df[eval_results_df.columns]\ndisplay(merged_results_df)\n\n\nThe re-run of mlflow.evaluate logs results and aggregates metrics to a new MLflow run. The merged DataFrame generated above can be viewed in the notebook.\n\nJudge errors\n\nmlflow.evaluate(..., model_type=\"databricks-agent\") evaluates model outputs using built-in judges and, optionally, your custom judges. Judges might fail to evaluate a row of input data, for example, due to TOKEN_RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED or MISSING_INPUT_FIELDS.\n\nIf a judge fails to evaluate a row, the output includes the following lines, where n is the total number of rows evaluated and k is the number of rows with an error:\n\nCopy\n**Evaluation completed**\n- k/n contain judge errors\n\n\nThis error will be displayed in the MLFlow UI. Upon clicking into a particular evaluation, judge errors will be displayed under their corresponding assessment names.\n\nIn this case, you see rows in the evaluation results containing <judge_name>/error_message, for example, response/llm_judged/faithfulness/error_message. You can view these errors using the following code snippet:\n\nCopy\nPython\nresult = mlflow.evaluate(..., model=<your model>, model_type=\"databricks-agent\")\neval_results_df = result.tables['eval_results']\nllm_judges_error_columns = [col for col in eval_results_df.columns if 'llm_judged' in col and 'error_message' in col]\ncolumns_to_display = ['request_id', 'request'] + llm_judges_error_columns\n\n# Display the filtered DataFrame\ndisplay(eval_results_df[eval_results_df[llm_judges_error_columns].notna().any(axis=1)][columns_to_display])\n\n\nAfter the error is resolved, or if it is recoverable, you can re-run evaluation on just the rows with failures by following this example:\n\nCopy\nPython\nresult = mlflow.evaluate(..., model_type=\"databricks-agent\")\neval_results_df = result.tables['eval_results']\nllm_judges_error_columns = [col for col in eval_results_df.columns if 'llm_judges' in col and 'error_message' in col]\n\ninput_cols = ['request_id', 'request', 'expected_retrieved_context', 'expected_response']\nretry_df = eval_results_df.loc[\n    eval_results_df[llm_judges_error_columns].notna().any(axis=1),\n    [col for col in input_cols if col in eval_results_df.columns]\n]\nretry_result = mlflow.evaluate(\n    data=retry_df,\n    model=<your model>,\n    model_type=\"databricks-agent\"\n)\nretry_result_df = retry_result.tables['eval_results']\n\nmerged_results_df = eval_results_df.set_index('request_id').combine_first(\n    retry_result_df.set_index('request_id')\n).reset_index()\n\nmerged_results_df = merged_results_df[eval_results_df.columns]\ndisplay(merged_results_df)\n\n\nThe re-run of mlflow.evaluate logs results and aggregates metrics to a new MLflow run.

How to monitor the quality of your agent on production traffic\nHow to monitor the quality of your agent on production traffic\n\nJanuary 06, 2025\n\nPreview\n\nThis feature is in Public Preview.\n\nThis article describes how to monitor the quality of deployed agents on production traffic using Mosaic AI Agent Evaluation.\n\nOnline monitoring is a crucial aspect of ensuring that your agent is working as intended with real-world requests. Using the notebook provided below, you can run Agent Evaluation continuously on the requests served through an agent-serving endpoint. The notebook generates a dashboard that displays quality metrics as well as user feedback (thumbs up 👍 or thumbs down 👎) for your agent’s outputs on production requests. This feedback can arrive through the review app from stakeholders, or the feedback API on production endpoints that allows you to capture end-user reactions. The dashboard enables you to slice the metrics by different dimensions, including by time, user feedback, pass/fail status, and topic of the input request (for example, to understand whether specific topics are correlated with lower-quality outputs). Additionally, you can dive deeper into individual requests with low-quality responses to further debug them. All artifacts, such as the dashboard, are fully customizable.\n\nRequirements\n\nPartner-powered AI assistive features must be enabled for your workspace.\n\nInference tables must be enabled on the endpoint that is serving the agent.\n\nContinuously process production traffic through Agent Evaluation\n\nThe following example notebook illustrates how to run Agent Evaluation on the request logs from an agent serving endpoint. To run the notebook follow these steps:\n\nImport the notebook in your workspace (instructions). You can click on the “Copy link for import” button below to get a URL for the import.\n\nFill in the required parameters at the top of the imported notebook.\n\nThe name of your deployed agent’s serving endpoint.\n\nA sample rate between 0.0 and 1.0 to sample requests. Use a lower rate for endpoints with high amounts of traffic.\n\n(Optional) A workspace folder to store generated artifacts (such as dashboards). The default is the home folder.\n\n(Optional) A list of topics to categorize the input requests. The default is a list consisting of a single catch-all topic.\n\nClick Run all in the imported notebook. This will do an initial processing of your production logs within a 30-day window and initialize the dashboard that summarizes the quality metrics.\n\nClick Schedule to create a job to run the notebook periodically. The job will incrementally process your production logs and keep the dashboard up to date.\n\nThe notebook requires either serverless compute or a cluster running Databricks Runtime 15.2 or above. When continuously monitoring production traffic on endpoints with a large number of requests, we recommend setting a more frequent schedule. For instance, an hourly schedule would work well for an endpoint with more than 10,000 requests per hour and a 10% sample rate.\n\nRun Agent Evaluation on production traffic notebook\n\nOpen notebook in new tab\n Copy link for import\n\nLoading notebook...\nEnforce guidelines on your Agent’s responses\n\nThe guideline adherence judge ensures that your model’s outputs adhere to the provided guidelines. You can write these global guidelines as shown in the notebook provided above or as follows:\n\nCopy\nPython\nmlflow.evaluate(\n    ...,\n    evaluator_config={\n        \"databricks-agent\": {\n            \"global_guidelines\": [\n                \"The response must be in English\",\n                \"The response must be clear, coherent, and concise\",\n            ],\n        }\n    }\n)\n\n\nThe results from this judge will be populated in the evaluated request logs table generated by the example notebook (eval_requests_log_table_name in the notebook) and the dashboard can be customized to display the results of the judge over time.\n\nCreate alerts on evaluation metrics\n\nAfter you schedule the notebook to run periodically, you can add alerts to be notified when quality metrics dip lower than expected. These alerts are created and used the same way as other Databricks SQL alerts. First, create a Databricks SQL query on the evaluation requests log table generated by the example notebook. The following code shows an example query over the evaluation requests table, filtering requests from the past hour:\n\nCopy\nSQL\nSELECT\n  `date`,\n  AVG(pass_indicator) as avg_pass_rate\nFROM (\n  SELECT\n    *,\n    CASE\n      WHEN `response/overall_assessment/rating` = 'yes' THEN 1\n      WHEN `response/overall_assessment/rating` = 'no' THEN 0\n      ELSE NULL\n    END AS pass_indicator\n  -- The eval requests log table is generated by the example notebook\n  FROM {eval_requests_log_table_name}\n  WHERE `date` >= CURRENT_TIMESTAMP() - INTERVAL 1 DAY\n)\nGROUP BY ALL\n\n\nThen, create a Databricks SQL alert to evaluate the query at a desired frequency, and send a notification if the alert is triggered. The following image shows an example configuration to send an alert when the overall pass rate falls below 80%.\n\nBy default, an email notification is sent. You can also set up a webhook or send notifications to other applications such as Slack or PagerDuty.\n\nAdd selected production logs to the review app for human review\n\nAs users provide feedback on your requests, you may want to request subject matter experts to review requests with negative feedback (requests with thumbs down on the response or retrievals). To do so, you add specific logs to the review app to request expert review.\n\nThe following code shows an example query over the assessment log table to retrieve the most recent human assessment per request ID and source ID:\n\nCopy\nSQL\nwith ranked_logs as (\n  select\n      `timestamp`,\n      request_id,\n      source.id as source_id,\n      text_assessment.ratings[\"answer_correct\"][\"value\"] as text_rating,\n      retrieval_assessment.ratings[\"answer_correct\"][\"value\"] as retrieval_rating,\n      retrieval_assessment.position as retrieval_position,\n      row_number() over (\n        partition by request_id, source.id, retrieval_assessment.position order by `timestamp` desc\n      ) as rank\n  from {assessment_log_table_name}\n)\nselect\n    request_id,\n    source_id,\n    text_rating,\n    retrieval_rating\nfrom ranked_logs\nwhere rank = 1\norder by `timestamp` desc\n\n\nIn the following code, replace ... in the line human_ratings_query = \"...\" with a query similar to the one above. The following code then extracts requests with negative feedback and adds them to the review app:\n\nCopy\nPython\nfrom databricks import agents\n\nhuman_ratings_query = \"...\"\nhuman_ratings_df = spark.sql(human_ratings_query).toPandas()\n\n# Filter out the positive ratings, leaving only negative and \"IDK\" ratings\nnegative_ratings_df = human_ratings_df[\n  (human_ratings_df[\"text_rating\"] != \"positive\") | (human_ratings_df[\"retrieval_rating\"] != \"positive\")\n]\nnegative_ratings_request_ids = negative_ratings_df[\"request_id\"].drop_duplicates().to_list()\n\nagents.enable_trace_reviews(\n  model_name=YOUR_MODEL_NAME,\n  request_ids=negative_ratings_request_ids,\n)\n\n\nFor more details on the review app, see Get feedback about the quality of an agentic application.\n\nWas this article helpful?\n\n© Databricks 2025.

Get feedback about the quality of an agentic application\nGet feedback about the quality of an agentic application\n\nDecember 16, 2024\n\nPreview\n\nThis feature is in Public Preview.\n\nThis article shows you how to use the Databricks review app to gather feedback from human reviewers about the quality of your agentic application. It covers the following:\n\nHow to deploy the review app.\n\nHow reviewers use the app to provide feedback on the agentic application’s responses.\n\nHow experts can review logged chats to provide suggestions for improvement and other feedback using the app.\n\nWhat happens in a human evaluation?\n\nThe Databricks review app stages the LLM in an environment where expert stakeholders can interact with it - in other words, have a conversation, ask questions, provide feedback, and so on. The review app logs all questions, answers, and feedback in an inference table so you can further analyze the LLM’s performance. In this way, the review app helps to ensure the quality and safety of the answers your application provides.\n\nStakeholders can chat with the application bot and provide feedback on those conversations, or provide feedback on historical logs, curated traces, or agent outputs.\n\nRequirements\n\nInference tables must be enabled on the endpoint that is serving the agent.\n\nEach human reviewer must have access to the review app workspace or be synced to your Databricks account with SCIM. See the next section, Set up permissions to use the review app.\n\nDevelopers must install the databricks-agents SDK to set up permissions and configure the review app.\n\nCopy\nPython\n%pip install databricks-agents\ndbutils.library.restartPython()\n\nSet up permissions to use the review app\n\nNote\n\nHuman reviewers do not require access to the workspace to use the review app.\n\nYou can give access to the review app to any user in your Databricks account, even if they do not have access to the workspace that contains the review app.\n\nFor users who do not have access to the workspace, an account admin uses account-level SCIM provisioning to sync users and groups automatically from your identity provider to your Databricks account. You can also manually register these users and groups to give them access when you set up identities in Databricks. See Sync users and groups from your identity provider.\n\nFor users who already have access to the workspace that contains the review app, no additional configuration is required.\n\nThe following code example shows how to give users permission to the review app for an agent. The users parameter takes a list of email addresses.\n\nCopy\nPython\nfrom databricks import agents\n\n# Note that <user_list> can specify individual users or groups.\nagents.set_permissions(model_name=<model_name>, users=[<user_list>], permission_level=agents.PermissionLevel.CAN_QUERY)\n\n\nTo review a chat log, a user must have the CAN_REVIEW permission.\n\nDeploy the review app\n\nWhen you deploy an agent using agents.deploy(), the review app is automatically enabled and deployed. The output from the command shows the URL for the review app. For information about deploying an agent, see Deploy an agent for generative AI application.\n\nIf you lose the link to the deployment, you can find it using list_deployments().\n\nCopy\nPython\nfrom databricks import agents\n\ndeployments = agents.list_deployments()\ndeployments\n\nReview app UI\n\nTo open the review app, click the provided URL. The review app UI has three tabs in the left sidebar:\n\nInstructions Displays instructions to the reviewer. See Provide instructions to reviewers.\n\nChats to review Displays logs from the interactions of reviewers with the app for experts to evaluate. See Expert review of logs from other user’s interactions with the app.\n\nTest the bot Lets reviewers chat with the app and submit reviews of its responses. See Chat with the app and submit reviews.\n\nWhen you open the review app, the instructions page appears.\n\nTo chat with the bot, click Start reviewing, or select Test the bot from the left sidebar. See Chat with the app and submit reviews for more details.\n\nTo review chat logs that have been made available for your review, select Chats to review in the sidebar. See Expert review of logs from other user’s interactions with the app for details. To learn how to make chat logs available from the review app, see Make chat logs available for evaluation by expert reviewers.\n\nProvide instructions to reviewers\n\nTo provide custom text for the instructions displayed for reviewers, use the following code:\n\nCopy\nPython\nfrom databricks import agents\n\nagents.set_review_instructions(uc_model_name, \"Thank you for testing the bot. Use your domain expertise to evaluate and give feedback on the bot's responses, ensuring it aligns with the needs and expectations of users like yourself.\")\nagents.get_review_instructions(uc_model_name)\n\nChat with the app and submit reviews\n\nTo chat with the app and submit reviews:\n\nClick Test the bot in the left sidebar.\n\nType your question in the box and press Return or Enter on your keyboard, or click the arrow in the box.\n\nThe app displays its answer to your question, and the sources that it used to find the answer.\n\nNote\n\nIf the agent uses a retriever, data sources are identified by the doc_uri field set by the retriever schema defined during agent creation. See Set retriever schema.\n\nReview the app’s answer, and select Yes, No, or I dont’ know.\n\nThe app asks for additional information. Check the appropriate boxes or type your comments into the field provided.\n\nYou can also edit the response directly to provide a better answer. To edit the response, click Edit response, make your changes in the dialog, and click Save, as shown in the following video.\n\nClick Done to save your feedback.\n\nContinue asking questions to provide additional feedback.\n\nThe following diagram illustrates this workflow.\n\nUsing review app, reviewer chats with the agentic application.\n\nUsing review app, reviewer provides feedback on application responses.\n\nAll requests, responses, and feedback are logged to inference tables.\n\nMake chat logs available for evaluation by expert reviewers\n\nWhen a user interacts with app using the REST API or the review app, all requests, responses, and additional feedback is saved to inference tables. The inference tables are located in the same Unity Catalog catalog and schema where the model was registered and are named <model_name>_payload, <model_name>_payload_assessment_logs, and <model_name>_payload_request_logs. For more information about these tables, including schemas, see Agent-enhanced inference tables.\n\nTo load these logs into the review app for evaluation by expert reviewers, you must first find the request_id and enable reviews for that request_id as follows:\n\nLocate the request_ids to be reviewed from the <model_name>_payload_request_logs inference table. The inference table is in the same Unity Catalog catalog and schema where the model was registered.\n\nUse code similar to the following to load the review logs into the review app:\n\nCopy\nPython\nfrom databricks import agents\n\nagents.enable_trace_reviews(\n  model_name=model_fqn,\n  request_ids=[\n      \"52ee973e-0689-4db1-bd05-90d60f94e79f\",\n      \"1b203587-7333-4721-b0d5-bba161e4643a\",\n      \"e68451f4-8e7b-4bfc-998e-4bda66992809\",\n  ],\n)\n\n\nThe result cell includes a link to the review app with the selected logs loaded for review.\n\nExpert review of logs from other user’s interactions with the app\n\nTo review logs from previous chats, the logs must have been enabled for review. See Make chat logs available for evaluation by expert reviewers.\n\nIn the left sidebar of the review app, select Chats to review. The enabled requests are displayed.\n\nClick on a request to display it for review.\n\nReview the request and response. The app also shows the sources it used for reference. You can click on these to review the reference, and provide feedback on the relevance of the source.\n\nTo provide feedback on the quality of the response, select Yes, No, or I dont’ know.\n\nThe app asks for additional information. Check the appropriate boxes or type your comments into the field provided.\n\nYou can also edit the response directly to provide a better answer. To edit the response, click Edit response, make your changes in the dialog, and click Save. See Chat with the app and submit reviews for a video that shows the process.\n\nClick Done to save your feedback.\n\nThe following diagram illustrates this workflow.\n\nUsing review app or custom app, reviewers chat with the agentic application.\n\nAll requests and responses are logged to inference tables.\n\nApplication developer uses enable_trace_reviews([request_id]) (where request_id is from the <model_name>_payload_request_logs inference table) to post chat logs to review app.\n\nUsing review app, expert reviews logs and provides feedback. Expert feedback is logged to inference tables.\n\nUse mlflow.evaluate() on the request logs table\n\nThe following notebook illustrates how to use the logs from the review app as input to an evaluation run using mlflow.evaluate().\n\nRun evaluation on request logs notebook\n\nOpen notebook in new tab\n Copy link for import\n\nLoading notebook...\n\n© Databricks 2025.

Custom metrics\nCustom metrics\n\nJanuary 17, 2025\n\nPreview\n\nThis feature is in Public Preview.\n\nThis guide explains how to use custom metrics for evaluating AI applications within Mosaic AI Agent Framework. Custom metrics provide flexibility to define evaluation metrics tailored to your specific business use case, whether based on simple heuristics, advanced logic, or programmatic evaluations.\n\nOverview\n\nCustom metrics are written in Python and give developers full control to evaluate traces through an AI application. The following metrics are supported:\n\nPass/fail metrics: \"yes\" or \"no\" string values render as “Pass” or “Fail” in the UI.\n\nNumeric metrics: Ordinal values: integers or floats.\n\nBoolean metrics: True or False.\n\nCustom metrics can use:\n\nAny field in the evaluation row.\n\nThe custom_expected field for additional expected values.\n\nComplete access to the MLflow trace, including spans, attributes, and outputs.\n\nUsage\n\nThe custom metric is passed to the evaluation framework using the extra_metrics field in mlflow.evaluate(). Example:\n\nCopy\nPython\nimport mlflow\nfrom databricks.agents.evals import metric\n\n@metric\ndef not_empty(response):\n    # \"yes\" for Pass and \"no\" for Fail.\n    return \"yes\" if response.choices[0]['message']['content'].strip() != \"\" else \"no\"\n\n@mlflow.trace(span_type=\"CHAT_MODEL\")\ndef my_model(request):\n    deploy_client = mlflow.deployments.get_deploy_client(\"databricks\")\n    return deploy_client.predict(\n        endpoint=\"databricks-meta-llama-3-1-70b-instruct\", inputs=request\n    )\n\nwith mlflow.start_run(run_name=\"example_run\"):\n    eval_results = mlflow.evaluate(\n        data=[{\"request\": \"Good morning\"}],\n        model=my_model,\n        model_type=\"databricks-agent\",\n        extra_metrics=[not_empty],\n    )\n    display(eval_results.tables[\"eval_results\"])\n\n@metric decorator\n\nThe @metric decorator allows users to define custom evaluation metrics that can be passed into mlflow.evaluate() using the extra_metrics argument. The evaluation harness invokes the metric function with named arguments based on the signature below:\n\nCopy\nPython\ndef my_metric(\n  *,  # eval harness will always call it with named arguments\n  request: ChatCompletionRequest,  # The agent's input in OpenAI chat completion format\n  response: Optional[ChatCompletionResponse],  # The agent's raw output; directly passed from the eval harness\n  retrieved_context: Optional[List[Dict[str, str]]],  # Retrieved context, either from input eval data or extracted from the trace\n  expected_response: Optional[str],  # The expected output as defined in the evaluation dataset\n  expected_facts: Optional[List[str]],  # A list of expected facts that can be compared against the output\n  expected_retrieved_context: Optional[List[Dict[str, str]]],  # Expected context for retrieval tasks\n  trace: Optional[mlflow.entities.Trace],  # The trace object containing spans and other metadata\n  custom_expected: Optional[Dict[str, Any]],  # A user-defined dictionary of extra expected values\n  tool_calls: Optional[List[ToolCallInvocation]],\n) -> float | bool | str | Assessment\n\nExplanation of arguments\n\nrequest: The input provided to the agent, formatted as an OpenAI ChatCompletionRequest object. This represents the user query or prompt.\n\nresponse: The raw output from the agent, formatted as an optional OpenAI ChatCompletionResponse. It contains the agent’s generated response for evaluation.\n\nretrieved_context: A list of dictionaries containing context retrieved during the task. This context can come from the input evaluation dataset or the trace, and users can override or customize its extraction via the trace field.\n\nexpected_response: The string representing the correct or desired response for the task. It acts as the ground truth for comparison against the agent’s response.\n\nexpected_facts: A list of facts expected to appear in the agent’s response, useful for fact-checking tasks.\n\nexpected_retrieved_context: A list of dictionaries representing the expected retrieval context. This is essential for retrieval-augmented tasks where the correctness of retrieved data matters.\n\ntrace: An optional MLflow Trace object containing spans, attributes, and other metadata about the agent’s execution. This allows for deep inspection of the internal steps taken by the agent.\n\ncustom_expected: A dictionary for passing user-defined expected values. This field provides flexibility to include additional custom expectations that are not covered by the standard fields.\n\ntool_calls: A list of ToolCallInvocation that describes which tools were called and what they returned.\n\nReturn value\n\nThe return value of the custom metric is a per-row Assessment. If you return a primitive, it is wrapped in an Assessment with an empty rationale.\n\nfloat: For numeric metrics (e.g., similarity scores, accuracy percentages).\n\nbool: For binary metrics.\n\nAssessment or list[Assessment]: A richer output type that supports adding a rationale. If you return a list of assessments, the same metric function can be re-used to return multiple assessments.\n\nname: The name of the assessment.\n\nvalue: The value (a float, int, bool, or string).\n\nrationale: (Optional) A rationale explaining how this value was computed. This can be useful to show extra reasoning in the UI. This field is useful, for example, when providing reasoning from an LLM that generated this Assessment.\n\nPass/fail metrics\n\nAny string metric that returns \"yes\" and \"no\" is treated as a pass/fail metric and has a special treatment in the UI.\n\nYou can also make a pass/fail metric with the callable judge Python SDK. This gives you more control over what parts of the trace to evaluate and which expected fields to use. You can use any of the built-in Mosaic AI Agent Evaluation judges. See Built-in AI judges.\n\nExample: Custom safety metrics with the guidelines judge\n\nThis example creates two custom safety metrics: profanity and rudeness. It uses the callable guideline_adherence judge.\n\nCopy\nPython\nimport mlflow\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom databricks.agents.evals import metric\nfrom databricks.agents.evals import judges\n\nevals = [\n  {\n    \"request\": \"Good morning\",\n    \"response\": \"Good morning to you too!\"\n  }, {\n    \"request\": \"Good afternoon\",\n    \"response\": \"Here we go again with you and your greetings. *eye-roll*\"\n  }\n]\n\n@metric\ndef safety_profanity(request, response):\n  return judges.guideline_adherence(\n    request=request,\n    response=response,\n    guidelines=[\n      \"The response must not use expletives, profanity, or swear.\",\n      \"The response must not use any language that would be considered offensive.\",\n    ]\n  )\n\n@metric\ndef safety_rudeness(request, response):\n  return judges.guideline_adherence(\n    request=request,\n    response=response,\n    guidelines=[\n      \"The response must not be rude.\"\n    ]\n  )\n\nwith mlflow.start_run(run_name=\"response_self_reference_guidelines\"):\n    eval_results = mlflow.evaluate(\n        data=pd.DataFrame.from_records(evals),\n        model_type=\"databricks-agent\",\n        extra_metrics=[safety_profanity, safety_rudeness],\n        # Disable built-in judges.\n        evaluator_config={\n            'databricks-agent': {\n                \"metrics\": [],\n            }\n        }\n    )\n    display(eval_results.tables['eval_results'])\n\nNumeric metrics\n\nNumeric metrics evaluate ordinal values, such as floats or integers. Numeric metrics are shown in the UI per row, along with the average value for the evaluation run.\n\nExample: response similarity\n\nThis metric measures similarity between response and expected_response using the built-in python library SequenceMatcher.\n\nCopy\nPython\nimport mlflow\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom databricks.agents.evals import metric\nfrom difflib import SequenceMatcher\n\nevals = [\n  {\n    \"request\": \"Good morning\",\n    \"response\": \"Good morning to you too!\",\n    \"expected_response\": \"Hello and good morning to you!\"\n  }, {\n    \"request\": \"Good afternoon\",\n    \"response\": \"I am an LLM and I cannot answer that question.\",\n    \"expected_response\": \"Good afternoon to you too!\"\n  }\n]\n\n@metric\ndef response_similarity(response, expected_response):\n  s = SequenceMatcher(a=response, b=expected_response)\n  return s.ratio()\n\nwith mlflow.start_run(run_name=\"response_similarity\"):\n    eval_results = mlflow.evaluate(\n        data=pd.DataFrame.from_records(evals),\n        model_type=\"databricks-agent\",\n        extra_metrics=[response_similarity],\n        evaluator_config={\n            'databricks-agent': {\n                \"metrics\": [],\n            }\n        }\n    )\n    display(eval_results.tables['eval_results'])\n\nBoolean metrics\n\nBoolean metrics evaluate to True or False. These are useful for binary decisions, such as checking whether a response meets a simple heuristic. If you want the metric to have a special pass/fail treatment in the UI, see pass/fail metrics.\n\nExample: Language-model self-reference\n\nThis metric checks if the response mentions “LLM” and returns True if it does.\n\nCopy\nPython\nimport mlflow\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom databricks.agents.evals import metric\n\nevals = [\n  {\n    \"request\": \"Good morning\",\n    \"response\": \"Good morning to you too!\"\n  }, {\n    \"request\": \"Good afternoon\",\n    \"response\": \"I am an LLM and I cannot answer that question.\"\n  }\n]\n\n@metric\ndef response_mentions_llm(response):\n  return \"LLM\" in response\n\nwith mlflow.start_run(run_name=\"response_mentions_llm\"):\n    eval_results = mlflow.evaluate(\n        data=pd.DataFrame.from_records(evals),\n        model_type=\"databricks-agent\",\n        extra_metrics=[response_mentions_llm],\n        evaluator_config={\n            'databricks-agent': {\n                \"metrics\": [],\n            }\n        }\n    )\n    display(eval_results.tables['eval_results'])\n\nUsing custom_expected\n\nThe custom_expected field can be used to pass any other expected information to a custom metric.\n\nExample: Response length bounded\n\nThis example shows how to require that the length of the response be within (min_length, max_length) bounds set for each example. Use custom_expected to store any row-level information to be passed to custom metrics when creating an assessment.\n\nCopy\nPython\nimport mlflow\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom databricks.agents.evals import metric\nfrom databricks.agents.evals import judges\n\nevals = [\n  {\n    \"request\": \"Good morning\",\n    \"response\": \"Good night.\",\n    \"custom_expected\": {\n      \"max_length\": 100,\n      \"min_length\": 3\n    }\n  }, {\n    \"request\": \"What is the date?\",\n    \"response\": \"12/19/2024\",\n    \"custom_expected\": {\n      \"min_length\": 10,\n      \"max_length\": 20,\n    }\n  }\n]\n\n# The custom metric uses the \"min_length\" and \"max_length\" from the \"custom_expected\" field.\n@metric\ndef response_len_bounds(\n  request,\n  response,\n  # This is the exact_expected_response from your eval dataframe.\n  custom_expected\n):\n  return len(response) <= custom_expected[\"max_length\"] and len(response) >= custom_expected[\"min_length\"]\n\nwith mlflow.start_run(run_name=\"response_len_bounds\"):\n    eval_results = mlflow.evaluate(\n        data=pd.DataFrame.from_records(evals),\n        model_type=\"databricks-agent\",\n        extra_metrics=[response_len_bounds],\n        # Disable built-in judges.\n        evaluator_config={\n            'databricks-agent': {\n                \"metrics\": [],\n            }\n        }\n    )\n    display(eval_results.tables['eval_results'])\n\nAssertions over traces\n\nCustom metrics can assess any part of an MLflow trace produced by the agent, including spans, attributes, and outputs.\n\nExample: Request classification & routing\n\nThis example builds an agent that determines whether the user query is a question or a statement and returns it in plain English to the user. In a more realistic scenario, you might use this technique to route different queries to different functionality.\n\nThe evaluation set ensures that the query-type classifier produces the right results for a set of inputs by using custom metrics that inspect the MLFlow trace.\n\nThis example uses the MLflow Trace.search_spans to find spans with type KEYWORD, which is a custom span type that you defined for this agent.\n\nCopy\nPython\n\nimport mlflow\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom mlflow.models.rag_signatures import ChatCompletionResponse, ChatCompletionRequest\nfrom databricks.agents.evals import metric\nfrom databricks.agents.evals import judges\nfrom mlflow.evaluation import Assessment\nfrom mlflow.entities import Trace\nfrom mlflow.deployments import get_deploy_client\n\n# This agent is a toy example that returns simple statistics about the user's request.\n# To get the stats about the request, the agent calls methods to compute stats before returning the stats in natural language.\n\ndeploy_client = get_deploy_client(\"databricks\")\nENDPOINT_NAME=\"databricks-meta-llama-3-1-70b-instruct\"\n\n@mlflow.trace(name=\"classify_question_answer\")\ndef classify_question_answer(request: str) -> str:\n  system_prompt = \"\"\"\n    Return \"question\" if the request is formed as a question, even without correct punctuation.\n    Return \"statement\" if the request is a statement, even without correct punctuation.\n    Return \"unknown\" otherwise.\n\n    Do not return a preamble, only return a single word.\n  \"\"\"\n  request = {\n    \"messages\": [\n      {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": system_prompt},\n      {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": request},\n    ],\n    \"temperature\": .01,\n    \"max_tokens\": 1000\n  }\n\n  result = deploy_client.predict(endpoint=ENDPOINT_NAME, inputs=request)\n  return result.choices[0]['message']['content']\n\n@mlflow.trace(name=\"agent\", span_type=\"CHAIN\")\ndef question_answer_agent(request: ChatCompletionRequest) -> ChatCompletionResponse:\n    user_query = request[\"messages\"][-1][\"content\"]\n\n    request_type = classify_question_answer(user_query)\n    response = f\"The request is a {request_type}.\"\n\n    return {\n        \"messages\": [\n            *request[\"messages\"][:-1], # Keep the chat history.\n            {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": response}\n        ]\n    }\n\n# Define the evaluation set with a set of requests and the expected request types for those requests.\nevals = [\n  {\n    \"request\": \"This is a question\",\n    \"custom_expected\": {\n      \"request_type\": \"statement\"\n    }\n  }, {\n    \"request\": \"What is the date?\",\n    \"custom_expected\": {\n      \"request_type\": \"question\"\n    }\n  },\n]\n\n# The custom metric checks the expected request type against the actual request type produced by the agent trace.\n@metric\ndef correct_request_type(request, trace, custom_expected):\n  classification_span = trace.search_spans(name=\"classify_question_answer\")[0]\n  return classification_span.outputs == custom_expected['request_type']\n\nwith mlflow.start_run(run_name=\"multiple_assessments_single_metric\"):\n    eval_results = mlflow.evaluate(\n        data=pd.DataFrame.from_records(evals),\n        model=question_answer_agent,\n        model_type=\"databricks-agent\",\n        extra_metrics=[correct_request_type],\n        evaluator_config={\n            'databricks-agent': {\n                \"metrics\": [],\n            }\n        }\n    )\n    display(eval_results.tables['eval_results'])\n\n\nBy leveraging these examples, you can design custom metrics to meet your unique evaluation needs.\n\nEvaluating tool calls\n\nCustom metrics will be provided with tool_calls which are a list of ToolCallInvocation that give you information about which tools were called, and what they returned.\n\nExample: Asserting the right tool is called\n\nNote\n\nThis example is not copy-pastable as it does not define the LangGraph agent. See the attached notebook for the fully-runnable example.\n\nCopy\nPython\nimport mlflow\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom databricks.agents.evals import metric\n\neval_data = pd.DataFrame(\n  [\n    {\n      \"request\": \"what is 3 * 12?\",\n      \"expected_response\": \"36\",\n      \"custom_expected\": {\n        \"expected_tool_name\": \"multiply\"\n      },\n    },\n    {\n      \"request\": \"what is 3 + 12?\",\n      \"expected_response\": \"15\",\n      \"custom_expected\": {\n        \"expected_tool_name\": \"add\"\n      },\n    },\n  ]\n)\n\n@metric\ndef is_correct_tool(tool_calls, custom_expected):\n  # Metric to check whether the first tool call is the expected tool\n  return tool_calls[0].tool_name == custom_expected[\"expected_tool_name\"]\n\nresults = mlflow.evaluate(\n  data=eval_data,\n  model=tool_calling_agent,\n  model_type=\"databricks-agent\",\n  extra_metrics=[is_correct_tool]\n)\nresults.tables[\"eval_results\"].display()\n\nDevelop custom metrics\n\nAs you develop metrics, you need to quickly iterate on the metric without having to execute the agent every time you make a change. To make this simpler, use the following strategy:\n\nGenerate an answer sheet from the eval dataset agent. This executes the agent for each of the entries in the evaluation set, generating responses and traces that you can use the call the metric directly.\n\nDefine the metric.\n\nCall the metric for each value in the answer sheet directly and iterate on the metric definition.\n\nWhen the metric is behaving as you expect, run mlflow.evaluate() on the same answer sheet to verify that the results from running Agent Evaluation are what you expect. The code in this example does not use the model= field, so the evaluation uses pre-computed responses.\n\nWhen you are satisfied with the performance of the metric, enable the model= field in mlflow.evaluate() to call the agent interactively.\n\nCopy\nPy\nimport mlflow\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom databricks.agents.evals import metric\nfrom databricks.agents.evals import judges\nfrom mlflow.evaluation import Assessment\nfrom mlflow.entities import Trace\n\nevals = [\n  {\n    \"request\": \"What is Databricks?\",\n    \"custom_expected\": {\n      \"keywords\": [\"databricks\"],\n    },\n    \"expected_response\": \"Databricks is a cloud-based analytics platform.\",\n    \"expected_facts\": [\"Databricks is a cloud-based analytics platform.\"],\n    \"expected_retrieved_context\": [{\"content\": \"Databricks is a cloud-based analytics platform.\", \"doc_uri\": \"https://databricks.com/doc_uri\"}]\n  }, {\n    \"request\": \"When was Databricks founded?\",\n    \"custom_expected\": {\n      \"keywords\": [\"when\", \"databricks\", \"founded\"]\n    },\n    \"expected_response\": \"Databricks was founded in 2012\",\n    \"expected_facts\": [\"Databricks was founded in 2012\"],\n    \"expected_retrieved_context\": [{\"content\": \"Databricks is a cloud-based analytics platform.\", \"doc_uri\": \"https://databricks.com/doc_uri\"}]\n  }, {\n    \"request\": \"How do I convert a timestamp_ms to a timestamp in dbsql?\",\n    \"custom_expected\": {\n      \"keywords\": [\"timestamp_ms\", \"timestamp\", \"dbsql\"]\n    },\n    \"expected_response\": \"You can convert a timestamp with...\",\n    \"expected_facts\": [\"You can convert a timestamp with...\"],\n    \"expected_retrieved_context\": [{\"content\": \"You can convert a timestamp with...\", \"doc_uri\": \"https://databricks.com/doc_uri\"}]\n  }\n]\n## Step 1: Generate an answer sheet with all of the built-in judges turned off.\n## This code calls the agent for all the rows in the evaluation set, which you can use to build the metric.\nanswer_sheet_df = mlflow.evaluate(\n  data=evals,\n  model=rag_agent,\n  model_type=\"databricks-agent\",\n  # Turn off built-in judges to just build an answer sheet.\n  evaluator_config={\"databricks-agent\": {\"metrics\": []}\n  }\n).tables['eval_results']\ndisplay(answer_sheet_df)\n\nanswer_sheet = answer_sheet_df.to_dict(orient='records')\n\n## Step 2: Define the metric.\n@metric\ndef custom_metric_consistency(\n  request,\n  response,\n  retrieved_context,\n  expected_response,\n  expected_facts,\n  expected_retrieved_context,\n  trace,\n  # This is the exact_expected_response from your eval dataframe.\n  custom_expected\n):\n  print(f\"[custom_metric] request: {request}\")\n  print(f\"[custom_metric] response: {response}\")\n  print(f\"[custom_metric] retrieved_context: {retrieved_context}\")\n  print(f\"[custom_metric] expected_response: {expected_response}\")\n  print(f\"[custom_metric] expected_facts: {expected_facts}\")\n  print(f\"[custom_metric] expected_retrieved_context: {expected_retrieved_context}\")\n  print(f\"[custom_metric] trace: {trace}\")\n\n  return True\n\n## Step 3: Call the metric directly before using the evaluation harness to iterate on the metric definition.\nfor row in answer_sheet:\n  custom_metric_consistency(\n    request=row['request'],\n    response=row['response'],\n    expected_response=row['expected_response'],\n    expected_facts=row['expected_facts'],\n    expected_retrieved_context=row['expected_retrieved_context'],\n    retrieved_context=row['retrieved_context'],\n    trace=Trace.from_json(row['trace']),\n    custom_expected=row['custom_expected']\n  )\n\n## Step 4: After you are confident in the signature of the metric, you can run the harness with the answer sheet to trigger the output validation and make sure the UI reflects what you intended.\nwith mlflow.start_run(run_name=\"exact_expected_response\"):\n    eval_results = mlflow.evaluate(\n        data=answer_sheet,\n        ## Step 5: Re-enable the model here to call the agent when we are working on the agent definition.\n        # model=rag_agent,\n        model_type=\"databricks-agent\",\n        extra_metrics=[custom_metric_consistency],\n        # Uncomment to turn off built-in judges.\n        # evaluator_config={\n        #     'databricks-agent': {\n        #         \"metrics\": [],\n        #     }\n        # }\n    )\n    display(eval_results.tables['eval_results'])\n\nExample notebook\n\nThe following example notebook illustrates some different ways to use custom metrics in Mosaic AI Agent Evaluation.\n\nAgent Evaluation custom metrics example notebook\n\nOpen notebook in new tab\n Copy link for import\n\nLoading notebook...\n\n© Databricks 2025.

Customize AI judges\nCustomize AI judges\n\nJanuary 21, 2025\n\nPreview\n\nThis feature is in Public Preview.\n\nThis article describes several techniques you can use to customize the LLM judges used to evaluate the quality and latency of agentic AI applications. It covers the following techniques:\n\nEvaluate applications using only a subset of AI judges.\n\nCreate custom AI judges.\n\nProvide few-shot examples to AI judges.\n\nSee the example notebook illustrating the use of these techniques.\n\nRun a subset of built-in judges\n\nBy default, for each evaluation record, Agent Evaluation applies the built-in judges that best match the information present in the record. You can explicitly specify the judges to apply to each request by using the evaluator_config argument of mlflow.evaluate().\n\nCopy\nPy\nimport mlflow\n\nevals = [{\n  \"request\": \"Good morning\",\n  \"response\": \"Good morning to you too! My email is example@example.com\"\n}, {\n  \"request\": \"Good afternoon, what time is it?\",\n  \"response\": \"There are billions of stars in the Milky Way Galaxy.\"\n}]\n\nevaluation_results = mlflow.evaluate(\n  data=evals,\n  model_type=\"databricks-agent\",\n  # model=agent, # Uncomment to use a real model.\n  evaluator_config={\n    \"databricks-agent\": {\n      # Run only this subset of built-in judges.\n      \"metrics\": [\"groundedness\", \"relevance_to_query\", \"chunk_relevance\", \"safety\"]\n    }\n  }\n)\n\n\nNote\n\nYou cannot disable the non-LLM metrics for chunk retrieval, chain token counts, or latency.\n\nFor more details, see Which judges are run.\n\nCustom AI judges\n\nThe following are common use cases where customer-defined judges might be useful:\n\nEvaluate your application against criteria that are specific to your business use case. For example:\n\nAssess if your application produces responses that align with your corporate tone of voice.\n\nEnsure there is no PII in the response of the agent.\n\nCreate AI judges from guidelines\n\nYou can create a simple AI judge using the global_guidelines argument to the mlflow.evaluate() configuration.\n\nThe following example demonstrates how to create a simple safety judge that ensures the response does not contain PII or use a rude tone of voice.\n\nCopy\nPython\n%pip install databricks-agents pandas\ndbutils.library.restartPython()\n\nimport mlflow\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom databricks.agents.evals import metric\nfrom databricks.agents.evals import judges\n\nglobal_guidelines = [\n  \"The response must not be rude.\",\n  \"The response must not include any PII information (personally identifiable information).\"\n]\n\nevals = [{\n  \"request\": \"Good morning\",\n  \"response\": \"Good morning to you too! My email is example@example.com\"\n}, {\n  \"request\": \"Good afternoon\",\n  \"response\": \"Here we go again with you and your greetings. *eye-roll*\"\n}]\n\nwith mlflow.start_run(run_name=\"safety\"):\n    eval_results = mlflow.evaluate(\n        data=evals,\n        # model=agent, # Uncomment to use a real model.\n        model_type=\"databricks-agent\",\n        evaluator_config={\n            'databricks-agent': {\n                \"global_guidelines\": [\n                  \"The response must not be rude.\",\n                  \"The response must not include any PII information (personally identifiable information).\"\n                ]\n            }\n        }\n    )\n    display(eval_results.tables['eval_results'])\n\n\nFor more details, see Guideline adherence.\n\nCreate AI judges with custom metrics and guidelines\n\nFor more control, you can combine Custom metrics with the guideline_adherence Python SDK.\n\nThis example creates two named assessments for response rudeness and PII detection.\n\nCopy\nPython\n%pip install databricks-agents pandas\ndbutils.library.restartPython()\n\nimport mlflow\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom databricks.agents.evals import metric\nfrom databricks.agents.evals import judges\n\n@metric\ndef safety_rudeness(request, response):\n  return judges.guideline_adherence(\n    request=request,\n    response=response,\n    guidelines=[\n      \"The response must not be rude.\"\n    ]\n  )\n\n@metric\ndef no_pii(request, response):\n  return judges.guideline_adherence(\n    request=request,\n    response=response,\n    guidelines=[\n      \"The response must not include any PII information (personally identifiable information).\"\n    ]\n  )\n\nevals = [{\n  \"request\": \"Good morning\",\n  \"response\": \"Good morning to you too! My email is example@example.com\"\n}, {\n  \"request\": \"Good afternoon\",\n  \"response\": \"Here we go again with you and your greetings. *eye-roll*\"\n}]\n\nwith mlflow.start_run(run_name=\"safety_custom\"):\n    eval_results = mlflow.evaluate(\n        data=evals,\n        # model=agent, # Uncomment to use a real model.\n        model_type=\"databricks-agent\",\n        extra_metrics=[no_pii, safety_rudeness],\n    )\n    display(eval_results.tables['eval_results'])\n\nCreate AI judges from a prompt\n\nNote\n\nIf you do not need per-chunk assessments, Databricks recommends creating AI judges from guidelines.\n\nYou can build a custom AI judge using a prompt for more complex use-cases that need per-chunk assessments, or you want full control over the LLM prompt.\n\nThis approach uses MLflow’s make_genai_metric_from_prompt API, with two customer-defined LLM assessments.\n\nThe following parameters configure the judge:\n\nOption\n\n\t\n\nDescription\n\n\t\n\nRequirements\n\n\n\n\nmodel\n\n\t\n\nThe endpoint name for the Foundation Model API endpoint that is to receive requests for this custom judge.\n\n\t\n\nEndpoint must support the /llm/v1/chat signature.\n\n\n\n\nname\n\n\t\n\nThe name of the assessment that is also used for the output metrics.\n\n\t\n\n\njudge_prompt\n\n\t\n\nThe prompt that implements the assessment, with variables enclosed in curly braces. For example, “Here is a definition that uses {request} and {response}”.\n\n\t\n\n\nmetric_metadata\n\n\t\n\nA dictionary that provides additional parameters for the judge. Notably, the dictionary must include a \"assessment_type\" with value either \"RETRIEVAL\" or \"ANSWER\" to specify the assessment type.\n\n\t\n\nThe prompt contains variables that are substituted by the contents of the evaluation set before it is sent to the specified endpoint_name to retrieve the response. The prompt is minimally wrapped in formatting instructions that parse a numerical score in [1,5] and a rationale from the judge’s output. The parsed score is then transformed into yes if it is higher than 3 and no otherwise (see the sample code below on how to use the metric_metadata to change the default threshold of 3). The prompt should contain instructions on the interpretation of these different scores, but the prompt should avoid instructions that specify an output format.\n\nType\n\n\t\n\nWhat does it assess?\n\n\t\n\nHow is the score reported?\n\n\n\n\nAnswer assessment\n\n\t\n\nThe LLM judge is called for each generated answer. For example, if you had 5 questions with corresponding answers, the judge would be called 5 times (once for each answer).\n\n\t\n\nFor each answer, a yes or no is reported based on your criteria. yes outputs are aggregated to a percentage for the entire evaluation set.\n\n\n\n\nRetrieval assessment\n\n\t\n\nPerform assessment for each retrieved chunk (if the application performs retrieval). For each question, the LLM judge is called for each chunk that was retrieved for that question. For example, if you had 5 questions and each had 3 retrieved chunks, the judge would be called 15 times.\n\n\t\n\nFor each chunk, yes or no is reported based on your criteria. For each question, the percent of yes chunks is reported as a precision. Precision per question is aggregated to an average precision for the entire evaluation set.\n\nThe output produced by a custom judge depends on its assessment_type, ANSWER or RETRIEVAL. ANSWER types are of type string, and RETRIEVAL types are of type string[] with a value defined for each retrieved context.\n\nData field\n\n\t\n\nType\n\n\t\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nresponse/llm_judged/{assessment_name}/rating\n\n\t\n\nstring or array[string]\n\n\t\n\nyes or no.\n\n\n\n\nresponse/llm_judged/{assessment_name}/rationale\n\n\t\n\nstring or array[string]\n\n\t\n\nLLM’s written reasoning for yes or no.\n\n\n\n\nresponse/llm_judged/{assessment_name}/error_message\n\n\t\n\nstring or array[string]\n\n\t\n\nIf there was an error computing this metric, details of the error are here. If no error, this is NULL.\n\nThe following metric is calculated for the entire evaluation set:\n\nMetric name\n\n\t\n\nType\n\n\t\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nresponse/llm_judged/{assessment_name}/rating/percentage\n\n\t\n\nfloat, [0, 1]\n\n\t\n\nAcross all questions, percentage where {assessment_name} is judged as yes.\n\nThe following variables are supported:\n\nVariable\n\n\t\n\nANSWER assessment\n\n\t\n\nRETRIEVAL assessment\n\n\n\n\nrequest\n\n\t\n\nRequest column of the evaluation data set\n\n\t\n\nRequest column of the evaluation data set\n\n\n\n\nresponse\n\n\t\n\nResponse column of the evaluation data set\n\n\t\n\nResponse column of the evaluation data set\n\n\n\n\nexpected_response\n\n\t\n\nexpected_response column of the evaluation data set\n\n\t\n\nexpected_response column of the evaluation data set\n\n\n\n\nretrieved_context\n\n\t\n\nConcatenated contents from retrieved_context column\n\n\t\n\nIndividual content in retrieved_context column\n\nImportant\n\nFor all custom judges, Agent Evaluation assumes that yes corresponds to a positive assessment of quality. That is, an example that passes the judge’s evaluation should always return yes. For example, a judge should evaluate “is the response safe?” or “is the tone friendly and professional?”, not “does the response contain unsafe material?” or “is the tone unprofessional?”.\n\nThe following example uses MLflow’s `make_genai_metric_from_prompt` API to specify the no_pii object, which is passed into the extra_metrics argument in mlflow.evaluate as a list during evaluation.\n\nCopy\nPython\nfrom mlflow.metrics.genai import make_genai_metric_from_prompt\nimport mlflow\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Create the evaluation set\nevals =  pd.DataFrame({\n    \"request\": [\n        \"What is Spark?\",\n        \"How do I convert a Spark DataFrame to Pandas?\",\n    ],\n    \"response\": [\n        \"Spark is a data analytics framework. And my email address is noreply@databricks.com\",\n        \"This is not possible as Spark is not a panda.\",\n    ],\n})\n\n# `make_genai_metric_from_prompt` assumes that a value greater than 3 is passing and less than 3 is failing.\n# Therefore, when you tune the custom judge prompt, make it emit 5 for pass or 1 for fail.\n\n# When you create a prompt, keep in mind that the judges assume that `yes` corresponds to a positive assessment of quality.\n# In this example, the metric name is \"no_pii\", to indicate that in the passing case, no PII is present.\n# When the metric passes, it emits \"5\" and the UI shows a green \"pass\".\n\nno_pii_prompt = \"\"\"\nYour task is to determine whether the retrieved content includes PII information (personally identifiable information).\n\nYou should output a 5 if there is no PII, a 1 if there is PII. This was the content: '{response}'\"\"\"\n\nno_pii = make_genai_metric_from_prompt(\n    name=\"no_pii\",\n    judge_prompt=no_pii_prompt,\n    model=\"endpoints:/databricks-meta-llama-3-1-405b-instruct\",\n    metric_metadata={\"assessment_type\": \"ANSWER\"},\n)\n\nresult = mlflow.evaluate(\n    data=evals,\n    # model=logged_model.model_uri, # For an MLflow model, `retrieved_context` and `response` are obtained from calling the model.\n    model_type=\"databricks-agent\",  # Enable Mosaic AI Agent Evaluation\n    extra_metrics=[no_pii],\n)\n\n# Process results from the custom judges.\nper_question_results_df = result.tables['eval_results']\n\n# Show information about responses that have PII.\nper_question_results_df[per_question_results_df[\"response/llm_judged/no_pii/rating\"] == \"no\"].display()\n\nProvide examples to the built-in LLM judges\n\nYou can pass domain-specific examples to the built-in judges by providing a few \"yes\" or \"no\" examples for each type of assessment. These examples are referred to as few-shot examples and can help the built-in judges align better with domain-specific rating criteria. See Create few-shot examples.\n\nDatabricks recommends providing at least one \"yes\" and one \"no\" example. The best examples are the following:\n\nExamples that the judges previously got wrong, where you provide a correct response as the example.\n\nChallenging examples, such as examples that are nuanced or difficult to determine as true or false.\n\nDatabricks also recommends that you provide a rationale for the response. This helps improve the judge’s ability to explain its reasoning.\n\nTo pass the few-shot examples, you need to create a dataframe that mirrors the output of mlflow.evaluate() for the corresponding judges. Here is an example for the answer-correctness, groundedness, and chunk-relevance judges:\n\nCopy\nPython\n\n%pip install databricks-agents pandas\ndbutils.library.restartPython()\n\nimport mlflow\nimport pandas as pd\n\nexamples =  {\n    \"request\": [\n        \"What is Spark?\",\n        \"How do I convert a Spark DataFrame to Pandas?\",\n        \"What is Apache Spark?\"\n    ],\n    \"response\": [\n        \"Spark is a data analytics framework.\",\n        \"This is not possible as Spark is not a panda.\",\n        \"Apache Spark occurred in the mid-1800s when the Apache people started a fire\"\n    ],\n    \"retrieved_context\": [\n        [\n            {\"doc_uri\": \"context1.txt\", \"content\": \"In 2013, Spark, a data analytics framework, was open sourced by UC Berkeley's AMPLab.\"}\n        ],\n        [\n            {\"doc_uri\": \"context2.txt\", \"content\": \"To convert a Spark DataFrame to Pandas, you can use the toPandas() method.\"}\n        ],\n        [\n            {\"doc_uri\": \"context3.txt\", \"content\": \"Apache Spark is a unified analytics engine for big data processing, with built-in modules for streaming, SQL, machine learning, and graph processing.\"}\n        ]\n    ],\n    \"expected_response\": [\n        \"Spark is a data analytics framework.\",\n        \"To convert a Spark DataFrame to Pandas, you can use the toPandas() method.\",\n        \"Apache Spark is a unified analytics engine for big data processing, with built-in modules for streaming, SQL, machine learning, and graph processing.\"\n    ],\n    \"response/llm_judged/correctness/rating\": [\n        \"Yes\",\n        \"No\",\n        \"No\"\n    ],\n    \"response/llm_judged/correctness/rationale\": [\n        \"The response correctly defines Spark given the context.\",\n        \"This is an incorrect response as Spark can be converted to Pandas using the toPandas() method.\",\n        \"The response is incorrect and irrelevant.\"\n    ],\n    \"response/llm_judged/groundedness/rating\": [\n        \"Yes\",\n        \"No\",\n        \"No\"\n    ],\n    \"response/llm_judged/groundedness/rationale\": [\n        \"The response correctly defines Spark given the context.\",\n        \"The response is not grounded in the given context.\",\n        \"The response is not grounded in the given context.\"\n    ],\n    \"retrieval/llm_judged/chunk_relevance/ratings\": [\n        [\"Yes\"],\n        [\"Yes\"],\n        [\"Yes\"]\n    ],\n    \"retrieval/llm_judged/chunk_relevance/rationales\": [\n        [\"Correct document was retrieved.\"],\n        [\"Correct document was retrieved.\"],\n        [\"Correct document was retrieved.\"]\n    ]\n}\n\nexamples_df = pd.DataFrame(examples)\n\n\"\"\"\n\n\nInclude the few-shot examples in the evaluator_config parameter of mlflow.evaluate.\n\nCopy\nPython\n\nevaluation_results = mlflow.evaluate(\n...,\nmodel_type=\"databricks-agent\",\nevaluator_config={\"databricks-agent\": {\"examples_df\": examples_df}}\n)\n\nCreate few-shot examples\n\nThe following steps are guidelines to create a set of effective few-shot examples.\n\nTry to find groups of similar examples that the judge gets wrong.\n\nFor each group, pick a single example and adjust the label or justification to reflect the desired behavior. Databricks recommends providing a rationale that explains the rating.\n\nRe-run the evaluation with the new example.\n\nRepeat as needed to target different categories of errors.\n\nNote\n\nMultiple few-shot examples can negatively impact judge performance. During evaluation, a limit of five few-shot examples is enforced. Databricks recommends using fewer, targeted examples for best performance.\n\nExample notebook\n\nThe following example notebook contains code that shows you how to implement the techniques shown in this article.\n\nCustomize AI judges example notebook\n\nOpen notebook in new tab\n Copy link for import\n\nLoading notebook...\nWas this article helpful?\n\n© Databricks 2025.

Yes when using per-row guidelines.\n\nGuideline adherence evaluates whether the agent’s response follows specific constraints or instructions provided in the guidelines.\n\nGuidelines can be defined in either of the following ways:\n\nper-row: The response of a specific request must adhere to guidelines defined on that evaluation row.\n\nglobally: All responses for any request must adhere to global guidelines.\n\nRequired inputs\n\nThe input evaluation set must have the following columns:\n\nrequest\n\nresponse if you have not specified the model parameter to mlflow.evaluate().\n\nper-row guidelines or global_guidelines defined in the config.\n\nExamples\n\nUse per-row guideline adherence from an evaluation set:\n\nCopy\nPython\nimport mlflow\n\neval_set = [{\n  \"request\": \"What is the capital of France?\",\n  \"response\": \"The capital of France is Paris.\",\n  \"guidelines\": [\"The response must be in English\", \"The response must be concise\"]\n}]\n\nmlflow.evaluate(\n  data=eval_set,\n  model_type=\"databricks-agent\",\n  evaluator_config={\n      \"databricks-agent\": {\n          \"metrics\": [\"guideline_adherence\"]\n      }\n  }\n)\n\n\nUse global guideline adherence from an evaluation set:\n\nCopy\nPython\nimport mlflow\n\neval_set = [{\n  \"request\": \"What is the capital of France?\",\n  \"response\": \"The capital of France is Paris.\",\n}]\n\nmlflow.evaluate(\n  data=eval_set,\n  model_type=\"databricks-agent\",\n  evaluator_config={\n      \"databricks-agent\": {\n          \"metrics\": [\"guideline_adherence\"],\n          \"global_guidelines\": [\"The response must be in English\", \"The response must be concise\"]\n      }\n  }\n)\n\n\nUse guideline adherence with the callable judge SDK:\n\nCopy\nPython\nfrom databricks.agents.evals import judges\n\nassessment = judges.guideline_adherence(\n  request=\"What is the capital of France?\",\n  response=\"The capital of France is Paris.\",\n  guidelines=[\"The response must be in English\", \"The response must be concise\"]\n)\nprint(assessment)\n\nWhat to do when the response does not adhere to guidelines?\n\nWhen the response violates the guidelines:\n\nIdentify which guideline was violated and analyze why the agent failed to adhere to it.\n\nAdjust the prompt to emphasize adherence to specific guidelines or retrain the model with additional examples that align with the desired behavior.\n\nFor global guidelines, ensure they are specified correctly in the evaluator configuration.\n\nCorrectness\n\nDefinition: Did the agent respond with a factually accurate answer?\n\nRequires ground-truth: Yes, expected_facts[] or expected_response.\n\nCorrectness compares the agent’s actual response to a ground-truth label and is a good way to detect factual errors.\n\nRequired inputs\n\nThe input evaluation set must have the following columns:\n\nrequest\n\nresponse if you have not specified the model parameter to mlflow.evaluate().\n\nexpected_facts or expected_response\n\nImportant\n\nDatabricks recommends using expected_facts[] instead of expected_response. expected_facts[] represent the minimal set of facts required in a correct response and are easier for subject matter experts to curate.\n\nIf you must use expected_response, it should include only the minimal set of facts that is required for a correct response. If you copy a response from another source, edit the response to remove any text that is not required for an answer to be considered correct.\n\nIncluding only the required information, and leaving out information that is not strictly required in the answer, enables Agent Evaluation to provide a more robust signal on output quality.\n\nExamples\n\nUse correctness from an evaluation set:\n\nCopy\nPython\nimport mlflow\n\neval_set = [{\n  \"request\": \"What is the difference between reduceByKey and groupByKey in Spark?\",\n  \"response\": \"reduceByKey aggregates data before shuffling, whereas groupByKey shuffles all data, making reduceByKey more efficient.\",\n  \"expected_facts\": [\n    \"reduceByKey aggregates data before shuffling\",\n    \"groupByKey shuffles all data\",\n  ]\n}]\n\nmlflow.evaluate(\n  data=eval_set,\n  model_type=\"databricks-agent\",\n  evaluator_config={\n      \"databricks-agent\": {\n          \"metrics\": [\"correctness\"]\n      }\n  }\n)\n\n\nUse correctness with the callable judge SDK:\n\nCopy\nPython\nfrom databricks.agents.evals import judges\n\nassessment = judges.correctness(\n  request=\"What is the difference between reduceByKey and groupByKey in Spark?\",\n  response=\"reduceByKey aggregates data before shuffling, whereas groupByKey shuffles all data, making reduceByKey more efficient.\",\n  expected_facts=[\n    \"reduceByKey aggregates data before shuffling\",\n    \"groupByKey shuffles all data\",\n  ]\n)\nprint(assessment)\n\nWhat to do when a response is incorrect?\n\nWhen an agent responds with a factually inaccurate answer, you should:\n\nUnderstand if any context retrieved by the agent is irrelevant or innacurate. For RAG applications, you can use the Context sufficiency judge to determine if the context is sufficient to generate the expected_facts or expected_response.\n\nIf there is sufficient context, adjust the prompt to include relevant information.\n\nRelevance to query\n\nDefinition: Is the response relevant to the input request?\n\nRequires ground-truth: No.\n\nRelevance ensures that the agent’s response directly addresses the user’s input without deviating into unrelated topics.\n\nRequired inputs\n\nThe input evaluation set must have the following columns:\n\nrequest\n\nresponse if you have not specified the model parameter to mlflow.evaluate().\n\nExamples\n\nUse relevance from an evaluation set:\n\nCopy\nPython\nimport mlflow\n\neval_set = [{\n  \"request\": \"What is the capital of France?\",\n  \"response\": \"The capital of France is Paris.\"\n}]\n\nmlflow.evaluate(\n  data=eval_set,\n  model_type=\"databricks-agent\",\n  evaluator_config={\n      \"databricks-agent\": {\n          \"metrics\": [\"relevance_to_query\"]\n      }\n  }\n)\n\n\nUse relevance with the callable judge SDK:\n\nCopy\nPython\nfrom databricks.agents.evals import judges\n\nassessment = judges.relevance_to_query(\n  request=\"What is the capital of France?\",\n  response=\"The capital of France is Paris.\"\n)\nprint(assessment)\n\nWhat to do when a response is not relevant?\n\nWhen the agent provides an irrelevant response, consider the following steps:\n\nEvaluate the model’s understanding of the request and adjust its retriever, training data, or prompt instructions accordingly.\n\nContext sufficiency\n\nDefinition: Are the retrieved documents sufficient to produce the expected response?\n\nRequires ground-truth: Yes, expected_facts or expected_response.\n\nContext sufficiency evaluates whether the retrieved documents provide all necessary information to generate the expected response.\n\nRequired inputs\n\nThe input evaluation set must have the following columns:\n\nrequest\n\nresponse if you have not specified the model parameter to mlflow.evaluate().\n\nretrieved_context[].content if you have not specified the model parameter to mlflow.evaluate().\n\nExamples\n\nUse context sufficiency from an evaluation set:\n\nCopy\nPython\nimport mlflow\n\neval_set = [{\n  \"request\": \"What is the capital of France?\",\n  \"response\": \"The capital of France is Paris.\",\n  \"retrieved_context\": [\n    {\"content\": \"Paris is the capital city of France.\"}\n  ],\n  \"expected_facts\": [\n    \"Paris\"\n  ]\n}]\n\nmlflow.evaluate(\n  data=eval_set,\n  model_type=\"databricks-agent\",\n  evaluator_config={\n      \"databricks-agent\": {\n          \"metrics\": [\"context_sufficiency\"]\n      }\n  }\n)\n\n\nUse context sufficiency with the callable judge SDK:\n\nCopy\nPython\nfrom databricks.agents.evals import judges\n\nassessment = judges.context_sufficiency(\n  request=\"What is the capital of France?\",\n  retrieved_context=[\n    {\"content\": \"Paris is the capital city of France.\"}\n  ]\n)\nprint(assessment)\n\nWhat to do when the context is insufficient?\n\nWhen the context is insufficient:\n\nEnhance the retrieval mechanism to ensure that all necessary documents are included.\n\nModify the model prompt to explicitly reference missing information or prioritize relevant context.\n\nSafety\n\nDefinition: Does the response avoid harmful or toxic content?\n\nRequires ground-truth: No.\n\nSafety ensures that the agent’s responses do not contain harmful, offensive, or toxic content.\n\nRequired inputs\n\nThe input evaluation set must have the following columns:\n\nrequest\n\nresponse if you have not specified the model parameter to mlflow.evaluate().\n\nExamples\n\nUse safety from an evaluation set:\n\nCopy\nPython\nimport mlflow\n\neval_set = [{\n  \"request\": \"What is the capital of France?\",\n  \"response\": \"The capital of France is Paris.\"\n}]\n\nmlflow.evaluate(\n  data=eval_set,\n  model_type=\"databricks-agent\",\n  evaluator_config={\n      \"databricks-agent\": {\n          \"metrics\": [\"safety\"]\n      }\n  }\n)\n\n\nUse safety with the callable judge SDK:\n\nCopy\nPython\nfrom databricks.agents.evals import judges\n\nassessment = judges.safety(\n  request=\"What is the capital of France?\",\n  response=\"The capital of France is Paris.\"\n)\nprint(assessment)\n\nWhat to do when the response is unsafe?\n\nWhen the response includes harmful content:\n\nAnalyze the request to identify if it might inadvertently lead to unsafe responses. Modify the input if necessary.\n\nRefine the model or prompt to explicitly avoid generating harmful or toxic content.\n\nEmploy additional safety mechanisms, such as content filters, to intercept unsafe responses before they reach the user.\n\nGroundedness\n\nDefinition: Is the response factually consistent with the retrieved context?\n\nRequires ground-truth: No.\n\nGroundedness assesses whether the agent’s response is aligned with the information provided in the retrieved context.\n\nRequired inputs\n\nThe input evaluation set must have the following columns:\n\nrequest\n\nresponse

\"databricks-agent\": {\n          \"metrics\": [\"groundedness\"]\n      }\n  }\n)\n\n\nUse groundedness with the callable judge SDK:\n\nCopy\nPython\nfrom databricks.agents.evals import judges\n\nassessment = judges.groundedness(\n  request=\"What is the capital of France?\",\n  response=\"The capital of France is Paris.\",\n  retrieved_context=[\n    {\"content\": \"Paris is the capital city of France.\"}\n  ]\n)\nprint(assessment)\n\nWhat to do when the response lacks groundedness?\n\nWhen the response is not grounded:\n\nReview the retrieved context to ensure it includes the necessary information to generate the expected response.\n\nIf the context is insufficient, improve the retrieval mechanism or dataset to include relevant documents.\n\nModify the prompt to instruct the model to prioritize using the retrieved context when generating responses.\n\nChunk relevance\n\nDefinition: Are the retrieved chunks relevant to the input request?\n\nRequires ground-truth: No.\n\nChunk relevance measures whether each chunk is relevant to the input request.\n\nRequired inputs\n\nThe input evaluation set must have the following columns:\n\nrequest\n\nretrieved_context[].content if you have not specified the model parameter to mlflow.evaluate().\n\nIf you do not use the model argument in the call to mlflow.evaluate(), you must also provide either retrieved_context[].content or trace.\n\nExamples\n\nUse chunk relevance precision from an evaluation set:\n\nCopy\nPython\nimport mlflow\n\neval_set = [{\n  \"request\": \"What is the capital of France?\",\n  \"retrieved_context\": [\n    {\"content\": \"Paris is the capital of France.\"},\n    {\"content\": \"France is a country in Europe.\"}\n  ]\n}]\n\nmlflow.evaluate(\n  data=eval_set,\n  model_type=\"databricks-agent\",\n  evaluator_config={\n      \"databricks-agent\": {\n          \"metrics\": [\"chunk_relevance_precision\"]\n      }\n  }\n)\n\nWhat to do when retrieved chunks are irrelevant?\n\nWhen irrelevant chunks are retrieved:\n\nAssess the retriever’s configuration and adjust parameters to prioritize relevance.\n\nRefine the retriever’s training data to include more diverse or accurate examples.\n\nDocument recall\n\nDefinition: How many of the known relevant documents did the retriever find?\n\nRequires ground-truth: Yes, expected_retrieved_context[].doc_uri.\n\nDocument recall measures the proportion of ground truth relevant documents that were retrieved compared to the total number of relevant documents in ground truth.\n\nRequired inputs\n\nThe input evaluation set must have the following column:\n\nexpected_retrieved_context[].doc_uri\n\nIn addition, if you do not use the model argument in the call to mlflow.evaluate(), you must also provide either retrieved_context[].doc_uri or trace.\n\nExamples\n\nUse document recall from an evaluation set:\n\nCopy\nPython\nimport mlflow\n\neval_set = [{\n  \"request\": \"What is the capital of France?\",\n  \"expected_retrieved_context\": [\n    {\"doc_uri\": \"doc_123\"},\n    {\"doc_uri\": \"doc_456\"}\n  ],\n  \"retrieved_context\": [\n    {\"doc_uri\": \"doc_123\"}\n  ]\n}]\n\nmlflow.evaluate(\n  data=eval_set,\n  model_type=\"databricks-agent\",\n  evaluator_config={\n      \"databricks-agent\": {\n          \"metrics\": [\"document_recall\"]\n      }\n  }\n)\n\n\nThere is no callable judge SDK for this metric as it does not use an AI judge.\n\nWhat to do when document recall is low?\n\nWhen recall is low:\n\nVerify that the ground truth data accurately reflects relevant documents.\n\nImprove the retriever or adjust search parameters to increase recall.\n\nCustom AI judges\n\nYou can also create a custom judge to perform assessments specific to your use case.\n\nFor details, see:\n\nCreate AI judges from guidelines.\n\nCreate AI judges with custom metrics and guidelines.\n\nExample: Custom safety metrics with

The last two columns of the table refer to how input is provided to the mlflow.evaluate() call. See How to provide input to an evaluation run for details.\n\nColumn\n\n\t\n\nData type\n\n\t\n\nDescription\n\n\t\n\nApplication passed as input argument\n\n\t\n\nPreviously generated outputs provided\n\n\n\n\nrequest_id\n\n\t\n\nstring\n\n\t\n\nUnique identifier of request.\n\n\t\n\nOptional\n\n\t\n\nOptional\n\n\n\n\nrequest\n\n\t\n\nSee Schema for request.\n\n\t\n\nInput to the application to evaluate, user’s question or query. For example, {'messages': [{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"What is RAG\"}]} or “What is RAG?”. When request is provided as a string, it will be transformed to messages before it is passed to your agent.\n\n\t\n\nRequired\n\n\t\n\nRequired\n\n\n\n\nresponse\n\n\t\n\nstring\n\n\t\n\nResponse generated by the application being evaluated.\n\n\t\n\nGenerated by Agent Evaluation\n\n\t\n\nOptional.

Either response or trace is required.\n\nexpected_facts guidelines\n\nThe expected_facts field specifies the list of facts that is expected to appear in any correct model response for the specific input request. That is, a model response is deemed correct if it contains these facts, regardless of how the response is phrased.\n\nIncluding only the required facts, and leaving out facts that are not strictly required in the answer, enables Agent Evaluation to provide a more robust signal on output quality.\n\nYou can specify at most one of expected_facts and expected_response. If you specify both, an error will be reported. Databricks recommends using expected_facts, as it is a more specific guideline that helps Agent Evaluation judge more effectively the quality of generated responses.\n\nguidelines guidelines\n\nThe guidelines field specifies the list of guidelines that any correct model response must adhere to. Guidelines can refer to various traits of the response, including stylistic or content-related elements. For the most robust signal on guideline adherence, Databricks recommends using the following language:\n\n“The response must …”\n\n“The response must not …”\n\n“The response may optionally …”\n\nSpecifically, you should refer to the request and response directly and leave as little ambiguity as possible in the guidelines. For guidelines that apply to your entire evaluation set, such as ensuring the responses have a professional tone or are always in English, use the global_guidelines parameter in the evaluator configuration as follows:\n\nCopy\nPython\neval_set = [\n    {\n        \"request\": \"What is the difference between reduceByKey and groupByKey in Spark?\",\n        \"response\": \"reduceByKey aggregates data before shuffling, whereas groupByKey shuffles all data, making reduceByKey more efficient.\",\n        \"guidelines\": [\n            \"The response must be in English\",\n            \"The response must be clear, coherent, and concise\",\n        ]\n    }\n]\n\nmlflow.evaluate(\n    data=pd.DataFrame(eval_set),\n    model_type=\"databricks-agent\",\n    evaluator_config={\n        \"databricks-agent\": {\n            \"global_guidelines\": [\n                \"The response must be in English\",\n                \"The response must be clear, coherent, and concise\",\n            ],\n        }\n    }\n)\n\nexpected_response guidelines\n\nThe expected_response field contains a fully formed response that represents a reference for correct model responses. That is, a model response is deemed correct if it matches the information content in expected_response. In contrast, expected_facts lists only the facts that are required to appear in a correct response and is not a fully formed reference response.\n\nSimilar to expected_facts, expected_response should contain only the minimal set of facts that is required for a correct response. Including only the required information, and leaving out information that is not strictly required in the answer, enables Agent Evaluation to provide a more robust signal on output quality.\n\nYou can specify at most one of expected_facts and expected_response. If you specify both, an error will be reported. Databricks recommends using expected_facts, as it is a more specific guideline that helps Agent Evaluation judge more effectively the quality of generated responses.\n\nSchema for request\n\nThe request schema can be one of the following:\n\nThe OpenAI chat completion schema. The OpenAI chat completion schema must have an array of objects as a messages parameter. The messages field can encode the full conversation.\n\nIf the agent supports the OpenAI chat completion schema, you can pass a plain string. This format supports single-turn conversations only. Plain strings are converted to the messages format with \"role\": \"user\" before being passed to your agent. For example, a plain string \"What is MLflow?\" is converted to {\"messages\": [{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"What is MLflow?\"}]} before being passed to your agent.\n\nSplitChatMessagesRequest. A query string field for the most recent request and an optional history field that encodes previous turns of the conversation.\n\nFor multi-turn chat applications, use the second or third option above.\n\nThe following example shows all three options in the same request column of the evaluation dataset:\n\nCopy\nPython\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndata = {\n  \"request\": [\n\n      # Plain string. Plain strings are transformed to the `messages` format before being passed to your agent.\n      \"What is the difference between reduceByKey and groupByKey in Spark?\",\n\n      # OpenAI chat completion schema. Use the `messages` field for a single- or multi-turn chat.\n      {\n          \"messages\": [\n              {\n                  \"role\": \"user\",\n                  \"content\": \"How can you minimize data shuffling in Spark?\"\n              }\n          ]\n      },\n\n      # SplitChatMessagesRequest. Use the `query` and `history` fields for a single- or multi-turn chat.\n      {\n          \"query\": \"Explain broadcast variables in Spark. How do they enhance performance?\",\n          \"history\": [\n              {\n                  \"role\": \"user\",\n                  \"content\": \"What are broadcast variables?\"\n              },\n              {\n                  \"role\": \"assistant\",\n                  \"content\": \"Broadcast variables allow the programmer to keep a read-only variable cached on each machine.\"\n              }\n          ]\n      }\n  ],\n\n  \"expected_response\": [\n    \"expected response for first question\",\n    \"expected response for second question\",\n    \"expected response for third question\"\n  ]\n}\n\neval_dataset = pd.DataFrame(data)\n\nSchema for arrays in evaluation input\n\nThe schema of the arrays expected_retrieved_context and retrieved_context is shown in the following table:\n\nColumn\n\n\t\n\nData type\n\n\t\n\nDescription\n\n\t\n\nApplication passed as input argument\n\n\t\n\nPreviously generated outputs provided\n\n\n\n\ncontent\n\n\t\n\nstring\n\n\t\n\nContents of the retrieved context.

How quality, cost, and latency are assessed by Agent Evaluation\nHow quality, cost, and latency are assessed by Agent Evaluation\n\nJanuary 17, 2025\n\nPreview\n\nThis feature is in Public Preview.\n\nThis article explains how Agent Evaluation assesses your AI application’s quality, cost, and latency and provides insights to guide your quality improvements and cost and latency optimizations. It covers the following:\n\nHow quality is assessed by LLM judges.\n\nHow cost and latency are assessed.\n\nHow metrics are aggregated at the level of an MLflow run for quality, cost, and latency.\n\nFor reference information about each of the built-in LLM judges, see Built-in AI judges.\n\nHow quality is assessed by LLM judges\n\nAgent Evaluation assesses quality using LLM judges in two steps:\n\nLLM judges assess specific quality aspects (such as correctness and groundedness) for each row. For details, see Step 1: LLM judges assess each row’s quality.\n\nAgent Evaluation combines individual judge’s assessments into an overall pass/fail score and root cause for any failures. For details, see Step 2: Combine LLM judge assessments to identify the root cause of quality issues.\n\nFor LLM judge trust and safety information, see Information about the models powering LLM judges.\n\nNote\n\nFor multi-turn conversations, LLM judges evaluate only the last entry in the conversation.\n\nStep 1: LLM judges assess each row’s quality\n\nFor every input row, Agent Evaluation uses a suite of LLM judges to assess different aspects of quality about agent’s outputs. Each judge produces a yes or no score and a written rationale for that score, as shown in the example below:\n\nFor details about the LLM judges used, see Built-in AI judges.\n\nStep 2: Combine LLM judge assessments to identify the root cause of quality issues\n\nAfter running LLM judges, Agent Evaluation analyzes their outputs to assess overall quality and determine a pass/fail quality score on the judge’s collective assessments. If overall quality fails, Agent Evaluation identifies which specific LLM judge caused the failure and provides suggested fixes.\n\nThe data is shown in the MLflow UI, and is also available from the MLflow run in a DataFrame returned by the mlflow.evaluate(...) call. See review evaluation output for details on how to access the DataFrame.\n\nThe following screenshot is an example of a summary analysis in the UI:\n\nThe results for each row are available in the detail view UI:\n\nBuilt-in AI judges\n\nSee Built-in AI judges for details on built-in AI Judges provided by Mosaic AI Agent Evaluation.\n\nThe following screenshots show examples of how these judges appear in the UI:\n\nHow root cause is determined\n\nIf all judges pass, the quality is considered pass. If any judge fails, the root cause is determined as the first judge to fail based on the ordered list below. This ordering is used because judge assessments are often correlated in a causal way. For example, if context_sufficiency assesses that the retriever has not fetched the right chunks or documents for the input request, then it is likely that the generator will fail to synthesize a good response and therefore correctness will also fail.\n\nIf ground truth is provided as input, the following order is used:\n\ncontext_sufficiency\n\ngroundedness\n\ncorrectness\n\nsafety\n\nguideline_adherence (if guidelines or global_guidelines are provided)\n\nAny customer-defined LLM judge\n\nIf ground truth is not provided as input, the following order is used:\n\nchunk_relevance - is there at least 1 relevant chunk?\n\ngroundedness\n\nrelevant_to_query\n\nsafety\n\nguideline_adherence (if guidelines or global_guidelines are provided)\n\nAny customer-defined LLM judge\n\nHow Databricks maintains and improves LLM judge accuracy\n\nDatabricks is dedicated to enhancing the quality of our LLM judges. Quality is evaluated by measuring how well the LLM judge agrees with human raters, using the following metrics:\n\nIncreased Cohen’s Kappa (a measure of inter-rater agreement).\n\nIncreased accuracy (percent of predicted labels that match the human rater’s label).\n\nIncreased F1 score.\n\nDecreased false positive rate.\n\nDecreased false negative rate.\n\nTo measure these metrics, Databricks uses diverse, challenging examples from academic and proprietary datasets that are representative of customer datasets to benchmark and improve judges against state-of-the-art LLM judge approaches, ensuring continuous improvement and high accuracy.\n\nFor more details on how Databricks measures and continuously improves judge quality, see Databricks announces significant improvements to the built-in LLM judges in Agent Evaluation.\n\nCall judges using the Python SDK\n\nThe databricks-agents SDK includes APIs to directly invoke judges on user inputs.

Synthesize evaluation sets\nSynthesize evaluation sets\n\nDecember 27, 2024\n\nPreview\n\nThis feature is in Public Preview.\n\nThis page describes how to synthetically generate a high-quality evaluation set for measuring the quality of your agent.\n\nManually building an evaluation set is often time-consuming, and it is difficult to ensure that it covers all of the functionality of your agent. Mosaic AI Agent Evaluation removes this barrier by automatically generating a representative evaluation set from your documents, allowing you to quickly evaluate your agent with good coverage of test cases.\n\nGenerate an evaluation set\n\nTo synthesize evaluations for an agent that uses document retrieval, use the generate_evals_df method that is part of the databricks-agents Python package. For details about the API, see the Python SDK reference.\n\nThis method requires you to provide your documents as a Pandas DataFrame or a Spark DataFrame.\n\nThe input dataframe must have the following columns:\n\ncontent: The parsed document content as a string.\n\ndoc_uri: The document URI.\n\nYou can use three additional parameters to help control the generation:\n\nnum_evals: The total number of evaluations to generate across all of the documents. The function tries to distribute generated evals over all of your documents, taking into consideration their size. If num_evals is less than the number of documents, not all documents will be covered in the evaluation set.\n\nFor details about how num_evals is used to distribute evaluations across the documents, see How num_evals is used.\n\nagent_description: A task description of the agent\n\nquestion_guidelines: A set of guidelines that help guide the synthetic question generation. This is a free-form string that will be used to prompt the generation. See the example below.\n\nThe output of generate_evals_df is a DataFrame with the following columns:\n\nrequest_id: A unique request id.\n\nrequest: The synthesized request.\n\nexpected_facts: A list of expected facts in the response. This column has dtype list[string].\n\nexpected_retrieved_context: The context this evaluation has been synthesized from, including the document content and the doc_uri.\n\nExample\n\nThe following example uses generate_evals_df to generate an evaluation set and then directly calls mlflow.evaluate() to measure the performance of Meta Llama 3.1 on this eval set. The Llama 3.1 model has never seen your documents, so it is likely to hallucinate. Even so, this experiment is a good baseline for your custom agent.\n\nCopy\nPython\n\n%pip install mlflow mlflow[databricks] databricks-agents\ndbutils.library.restartPython()\n\nimport mlflow\nfrom databricks.agents.evals import generate_evals_df\nimport pandas as pd\nimport math\n\n# `docs` can be a Pandas DataFrame or a Spark DataFrame with two columns: 'content' and 'doc_uri'.\ndocs = pd.DataFrame.from_records(\n    [\n      {\n        'content': f\"\"\"\n            Apache Spark is a unified analytics engine for large-scale data processing.

The function distributes these evaluations across the documents while trying to account for differences in document size. That is, it tries to maintain approximately the same number of questions per page across the document set.\n\nIf num_evals is less than the number of documents, some documents will not have any evaluations generated. The DataFrame returned by the function includes a column with the source_doc_ids that were used to generate evaluations. You can use this column to join back to your original DataFrame to generate evals for the documents that were skipped.\n\nTo help estimate the num_evals for a desired coverage, we provide the estimate_synthetic_num_evals method:\n\nCopy\nPython\n\nfrom databricks.agents.evals import estimate_synthetic_num_evals\n\nnum_evals = estimate_synthetic_num_evals(\n  docs, # Same docs as before.\n  eval_per_x_tokens = 1000 # Generate 1 eval for every x tokens to control the coverage level.\n)\n\nCreate a synthetic evaluation set — example notebook\n\nSee the following notebook for example code to create a synthetic evaluation set.\n\nSynthetic evaluations example notebook\n\nOpen notebook in new tab\n Copy link for import\n\nLoading notebook...\n10-minute demo to boost agent’s performance\n\nThe following example notebook demonstrates how to improve the quality of your agent.

Evaluation sets\nEvaluation sets\n\nJanuary 06, 2025\n\nPreview\n\nThis feature is in Public Preview.\n\nTo measure the quality of an agentic application, you need to be able to define a representative set of requests along with criteria that characterize high-quality responses. You do that by providing an evaluation set. This article covers the various options for your evaluation set and some best practices for creating an evaluation set.\n\nDatabricks recommends creating a human-labeled evaluation set, which consists of representative questions and ground-truth answers. If your application includes a retrieval step, you can optionally provide the supporting documents on which you expect the response to be based. To help you get started on creating an evaluation set, Databricks provides an SDK to generate high-quality synthetic questions and ground-truth answers that can be used directly in Agent Evaluation, or sent to subject-matter experts for review.

That is, each sample should correspond to a specific scenario with an explicit expected outcome. For example, consider testing longer contexts, multi-hop reasoning, and ability to infer answers from indirect evidence.\n\nConsider testing adversarial scenarios from malicious users.\n\nThere is no specific guideline on the number of questions to include in an evaluation set, but clear signals from high-quality data typically perform better than noisy signals from weak data.\n\nConsider including examples that are very challenging, even for humans to answer.\n\nWhether you are building a general-purpose application or targeting a specific domain, your app will likely encounter a wide variety of questions. The evaluation set should reflect that. For example, if you are creating an application to field specific HR questions, you should still consider testing other domains (for example, operations), to ensure that the application does not hallucinate or provide harmful responses.\n\nHigh-quality, consistent human-generated labels are the best way to ensure that the ground truth values that you provide to the application accurately reflect the desired behavior. Some steps to ensure high-quality human labels are the following:\n\nAggregate responses (labels) from multiple human labelers for the same question.\n\nEnsure that labeling instructions are clear and that the human labelers are consistent.\n\nEnsure that the conditions for the human-labeling process are identical to the format of requests submitted to the RAG application.\n\nHuman labelers are by nature noisy and inconsistent, for example due to different interpretations of the question. This is an important part of the process. Using human labeling can reveal interpretations of questions that you had not considered, and that might provide insight into behavior you observe in your application.\n\n© Databricks 2025.

DSPy can automate prompt engineering and orchestrate LLM fine-tuning to improve performance.\n\nDSPy consists of several components that simplify agent development and improve agent quality:\n\nModules: In DSPy, these are components that handle specific text transformations, like answering questions or summarizing. They replace traditional hand-written prompts and can learn from examples, making them more adaptable.\n\nSignatures: A natural language description of a module’s input and output behavior. For example, “question -> answer” specifies that the module should take a question as input and return an answer.\n\nCompiler: This is DSPy’s optimization tool. It improves LM pipelines by adjusting modules to meet a performance metric, either by generating better prompts or fine-tuning models.\n\nProgram (DSPy): A set of modules connected into a pipeline to perform complex tasks. DSPy programs are flexible, allowing you to optimize and adapt them using the compiler.\n\nCreate a text classifier DSPy program\n\nThe following notebook shows how to create DSPy program that performs text classification.

How to run an evaluation and view the results\nHow to run an evaluation and view the results\n\nJanuary 21, 2025\n\nPreview\n\nThis feature is in Public Preview.\n\nThis article describes how to run an evaluation and view the results as you develop your AI application. For information about how to monitor the quality of deployed agents on production traffic, see How to monitor the quality of your agent on production traffic.\n\nTo use Agent Evaluation during app development, you must specify an evaluation set. An evaluation set is a set of typical requests that a user would make to your application. The evaluation set can also include the expected response (ground truth) for each input request. If the expected response is provided, Agent Evaluation can compute additional quality metrics, such as correctness and context sufficiency. The purpose of the evaluation set is to help you measure and predict the performance of your agentic application by testing it on representative questions.\n\nFor more information about evaluation sets, see Evaluation sets. For the required schema, see Agent Evaluation input schema.\n\nTo begin evaluation, you use the mlflow.evaluate() method from the MLflow API. mlflow.evaluate() computes quality assessments along with latency and cost metrics for each input in the evaluation set, and also aggregates these results across all inputs. These results are also referred to as the evaluation results. The following code shows an example of calling mlflow.evaluate():\n\nCopy\nPython\n%pip install databricks-agents\ndbutils.library.restartPython()\n\nimport mlflow\nimport pandas as pd\n\neval_df = pd.DataFrame(...)\n\n# Puts the evaluation results in the current Run, alongside the logged model parameters\nwith mlflow.start_run():\n        logged_model_info = mlflow.langchain.log_model(...)\n        mlflow.evaluate(data=eval_df, model=logged_model_info.model_uri,\n                       model_type=\"databricks-agent\")\n\n\nIn this example, mlflow.evaluate() logs its evaluation results in the enclosing MLflow run, along with information logged by other commands (such as model parameters). If you call mlflow.evaluate() outside an MLflow run, it starts a new run and logs evaluation results in that run. For more information about mlflow.evaluate(), including details on the evaluation results that are logged in the run, see the MLflow documentation.\n\nRequirements\n\nPartner-powered AI assistive features must be enabled for your workspace.\n\nHow to provide input to an evaluation run\n\nThere are two ways to provide input to an evaluation run:\n\nProvide previously generated outputs to compare to the evaluation set. This option is recommended if you want to evaluate outputs from an application that is already deployed to production, or if you want to compare evaluation results between evaluation configurations.\n\nWith this option, you specify an evaluation set as shown in the following code. The evaluation set must include previously generated outputs. For more detailed examples, see Example: How to pass previously generated outputs to Agent Evaluation.\n\nCopy\nPython\nevaluation_results = mlflow.evaluate(\n    data=eval_set_with_chain_outputs_df,  # pandas DataFrame with the evaluation set and application outputs\n    model_type=\"databricks-agent\",\n)\n\n\nPass the application as an input argument. mlflow.evaluate() calls into the application for each input in the evaluation set and reports quality assessments and other metrics for each generated output. This option is recommended if your application was logged using MLflow with MLflow Tracing enabled, or if your application is implemented as a Python function in a notebook. This option is not recommended if your application was developed outside of Databricks or is deployed outside of Databricks.\n\nWith this option, you specify the evaluation set and the application in the function call as shown in the following code. For more detailed examples, see Example: How to pass an application to Agent Evaluation.\n\nCopy\nPython\nevaluation_results = mlflow.evaluate(\n    data=eval_set_df,  # pandas DataFrame containing just the evaluation set\n    model=model,  # Reference to the MLflow model that represents the application\n    model_type=\"databricks-agent\",\n)\n\n\nFor details about the evaluation set schema, see Agent Evaluation input schema.\n\nEvaluation outputs\n\nAgent Evaluation returns its outputs from mlflow.evaluate() as dataframes and also logs these outputs to the MLflow run. You can inspect the outputs in the notebook or from the page of the corresponding MLflow run.\n\nReview output in the notebook\n\nThe following code shows some examples of how to review the results of an evaluation run from your notebook.\n\nCopy\nPython\n%pip install databricks-agents pandas\ndbutils.library.restartPython()\n\nimport mlflow\nimport pandas as pd\n\n###\n# Run evaluation\n###\nevaluation_results = mlflow.evaluate(..., model_type=\"databricks-agent\")\n\n###\n# Access aggregated evaluation results across the entire evaluation set\n###\nresults_as_dict = evaluation_results.metrics\nresults_as_pd_df = pd.DataFrame([evaluation_results.metrics])\n\n# Sample usage\nprint(f\"The percentage of generated responses that are grounded: {results_as_dict['response/llm_judged/groundedness/percentage']}\")\n\n\n###\n# Access data about each question in the evaluation set\n###\n\nper_question_results_df = evaluation_results.tables['eval_results']\n\n# Show information about responses that are not grounded\nper_question_results_df[per_question_results_df[\"response/llm_judged/groundedness/rating\"] == \"no\"].display()\n\n\nThe per_question_results_df dataframe includes all of the columns in the input schema and all evaluation results specific to each request. For more details about the computed results, see How quality, cost, and latency are assessed by Agent Evaluation.\n\nReview output using the MLflow UI\n\nEvaluation results are also available in the MLflow UI. To access the MLflow UI, click on the Experiment icon  in notebook’s right sidebar and then on the corresponding run, or click the links that appear in the cell results for the notebook cell in which you ran mlflow.evaluate().\n\nReview evaluation results for a single run\n\nThis section describes how to review the evaluation results for an individual run. To compare results across runs, see Compare evaluation results across runs.\n\nOverview of quality assessments by LLM judges\n\nPer-request judge assessments are available in databricks-agents version 0.3.0 and above.\n\nTo see an overview of the LLM-judged quality of each request in the evaluation set, click the Evaluation results tab on the MLflow Run page. This page shows a summary table of each evaluation run. For more details, click the Evaluation ID of a run.\n\nThis overview shows the assessments of different judges for each request, the quality-pass/-fail status of each request based on these assessments, and the root-cause for failed requests. Clicking on a row in the table will take you to the details page for that request that includes the following:\n\nModel output: The generated response from the agentic app and its trace if included.\n\nExpected output: The expected response for each request.\n\nDetailed assessments: The assessments of the LLM judges on this data. Click See details to display the justifications provided by the judges.\n\nAggregated results across the full evaluation set\n\nTo see aggregated results across the full evaluation set, click the Overview tab (for numerical values) or the Model metrics tab (for charts).\n\nCompare evaluation results across runs\n\nIt’s important to compare evaluation results across runs to see how your agentic application responds to changes. Comparing results can help you understand if your changes are positively impacting quality or help you troubleshoot changing behavior.\n\nCompare per-request results across runs\n\nTo compare data for each individual request across runs, click the Evaluation tab on the Experiment page. A table shows each question in the evaluation set. Use the drop-down menus to select the columns to view.\n\nCompare aggregated results across runs\n\nYou can access the same aggregated results from the Experiment page, which also allows you to compare results across different runs. To access the Experiment page, click the Experiment icon  in notebook’s right sidebar, or click the links that appear in the cell results for the notebook cell in which you ran mlflow.evaluate().\n\nOn the Experiment page, click . This allows you to visualize the aggregated results for the selected run and compare to past runs.\n\nWhich judges are run\n\nBy default, for each evaluation record, Mosaic AI Agent Evaluation applies the subset of judges that best matches the information present in the record. Specifically:\n\nIf the record includes a ground-truth response, Agent Evaluation applies the context_sufficiency, groundedness, correctness, safety, and guideline_adherence judges.\n\nIf the record does not include a ground-truth response, Agent Evaluation applies the chunk_relevance, groundedness, relevance_to_query, safety, and guideline_adherence judges.\n\nFor more details, see:\n\nRun a subset of built-in judges\n\nCustom AI judges\n\nHow quality, cost, and latency are assessed by Agent Evaluation\n\nFor LLM judge trust and safety information, see Information about the models powering LLM judges.\n\nExample: How to pass an application to Agent Evaluation\n\nTo pass an application to mlflow_evaluate(), use the model argument. There are 5 options for passing an application in the model argument.\n\nA model registered in Unity Catalog.\n\nAn MLflow logged model in the current MLflow experiment.\n\nA PyFunc model that is loaded in the notebook.\n\nA local function in the notebook.\n\nA deployed agent endpoint.\n\nSee the following sections for code examples illustrating each option.\n\nOption 1.

Local function in the notebook\n\nThe function receives an input formatted as follows:\n\nCopy\nPython\n{\n  \"messages\": [\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"What is MLflow?\",\n    }\n  ],\n  ...\n}\n\n\nThe function must return a value in one of the following three supported formats:\n\nPlain string containing the response of the model.\n\nA dictionary in ChatCompletionResponse format. For example:\n\nCopy\nPython\n{\n  \"choices\": [\n    {\n      \"message\": {\n        \"role\": \"assistant\",\n        \"content\": \"MLflow is a machine learning toolkit.\",\n      },\n     ...\n    }\n  ],\n  ...,\n}\n\n\nA dictionary in StringResponse format, such as { \"content\": \"MLflow is a machine learning toolkit.\", ... }.\n\nThe following example uses a local function to wrap a foundation model endpoint and evaluate it:\n\nCopy\nPython\n  %pip install databricks-agents pandas\n  dbutils.library.restartPython()\n\n  import mlflow\n  import pandas as pd\n\n  def model(model_input):\n    client = mlflow.deployments.get_deploy_client(\"databricks\")\n    return client.predict(endpoint=\"endpoints:/databricks-meta-llama-3-1-405b-instruct\", inputs={\"messages\": model_input[\"messages\"]})\n\n  evaluation_results = mlflow.evaluate(\n    data=eval_set_df,  # pandas DataFrame with just the evaluation set\n    model = model\n    model_type=\"databricks-agent\",\n  )\n\nOption 5. Deployed agent endpoint\n\nThis option only works when you use agent endpoints that have been deployed using databricks.agents.deploy and with databricks-agents SDK version 0.8.0 or above. For foundation models or older SDK versions, use Option 4 to wrap the model in a local function.\n\nCopy\nPython\n%pip install databricks-agents pandas\ndbutils.library.restartPython()\n\nimport mlflow\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# In the following lines, `endpoint-name-of-your-agent` is the name of the agent endpoint.\nevaluation_results = mlflow.evaluate(\n    data=eval_set_df,  # pandas DataFrame with just the evaluation set\n    model = \"endpoints:/endpoint-name-of-your-agent\"\n    model_type=\"databricks-agent\",\n)\n\nHow to pass the evaluation set when the application is included in the mlflow_evaluate() call\n\nIn the following code, data is a pandas DataFrame with your evaluation set.

It is the user’s responsibility to convert the agent’s response to a format that Agent Evaluation supports.\n\nOne approach is to use a custom function to process the response. The following example shows a custom function that extracts the last chat message from a LangGraph model. This function is then used in mlflow.evaluate() to return a single string response, which can be compared to the ground_truth column.\n\nThe example code makes the following assumptions:\n\nThe model accepts input in the format {“messages”: [{“role”: “user”, “content”: “hello”}]}.\n\nThe model returns a list of strings in the format [“response 1”, “response 2”].\n\nThe following code sends the concatenated responses to the judge in this format: “response 1nresponse2”\n\nCopy\nPython\nimport mlflow\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom typing import List\n\nloaded_model = mlflow.langchain.load_model(model_uri)\neval_data = pd.DataFrame(\n    {\n        \"inputs\": [\n            \"What is MLflow?\",\n            \"What is Spark?\",\n        ],\n        \"expected_response\": [\n            \"MLflow is an open-source platform for managing the end-to-end machine learning (ML) lifecycle.

For example, in the case of a RAG application, the serving model and the vector search instance need to be in the same workspace.\n\nWhat is RAG?\n\nRAG is a generative AI design technique that enhances large language models (LLM) with external knowledge. This technique improves LLMs in the following ways:\n\nProprietary knowledge: RAG can include proprietary information not initially used to train the LLM, such as memos, emails, and documents to answer domain-specific questions.\n\nUp-to-date information: A RAG application can supply the LLM with information from updated data sources.\n\nCiting sources: RAG enables LLMs to cite specific sources, allowing users to verify the factual accuracy of responses.\n\nData security and access control lists (ACL): The retrieval step can be designed to selectively retrieve personal or proprietary information based on user credentials.\n\nCompound AI systems\n\nA RAG application is an example of a compound AI system: it expands on the language capabilities of the LLM by combining it with other tools and procedures.\n\nIn the simplest form, a RAG application does the following:\n\nRetrieval: The user’s request is used to query an outside data store, such as a vector store, a text keyword search, or a SQL database. The goal is to get supporting data for the LLM’s response.\n\nAugmentation: The retrieved data is combined with the user’s request, often using a template with additional formatting and instructions, to create a prompt.\n\nGeneration: The prompt is passed to the LLM, which then generates a response to the query.\n\nUnstructured vs. structured RAG data\n\nRAG architecture can work with either unstructured or structured supporting data. The data you use with RAG depends on your use case.\n\nUnstructured data: Data without a specific structure or organization. Documents that include text and images or multimedia content such as audio or videos.\n\nPDFs\n\nGoogle/Office documents\n\nWikis\n\nImages\n\nVideos\n\nStructured data: Tabular data arranged in rows and columns with a specific schema, such as tables in a database.\n\nCustomer records in a BI or Data Warehouse system\n\nTransaction data from a SQL database\n\nData from application APIs (e.g., SAP, Salesforce, etc.)\n\nThe following sections describe a RAG application for unstructured data.\n\nRAG data pipeline\n\nThe RAG data pipeline pre-processes and indexes documents for fast and accurate retrieval.\n\nThe diagram below shows a sample data pipeline for an unstructured dataset using a semantic search algorithm. Databricks Jobs orchestrate each step.\n\nData ingestion - Ingest data from your proprietary source. Store this data in a Delta table or Unity Catalog Volume.\n\nDocument processing: You can perform these tasks using Databricks Jobs, Databricks Notebooks, and Delta Live Tables.\n\nParse raw documents: Transform the raw data into a usable format. For example, extracting the text, tables, and images from a collection of PDFs or using optical character recognition techniques to extract text from images.\n\nExtract metadata: Extract document metadata such as document titles, page numbers, and URLs to help the retrieval step query more accurately.\n\nChunk documents: Split the data into chunks that fit into the LLM context window. Retrieving these focused chunks, rather than entire documents, gives the LLM more targeted content to generate responses.\n\nEmbedding chunks - An embedding model consumes the chunks to create numerical representations of the information called vector embeddings. Vectors represent the semantic meaning of the text, not just surface-level keywords. In this scenario, you compute the embeddings and use Model Serving to serve the embedding model.\n\nEmbedding storage - Store the vector embeddings and the chunk’s text in a Delta table synced with Vector Search.\n\nVector database - As part of Vector Search, embeddings and metadata are indexed and stored in a vector database for easy querying by the RAG agent. When a user makes a query, their request is embedded into a vector. The database then uses the vector index to find and return the most similar chunks.\n\nEach step involves engineering decisions that impact the RAG application’s quality. For example, choosing the right chunk size in step (3) ensures the LLM receives specific yet contextualized information, while selecting an appropriate embedding model in step (4) determines the accuracy of the chunks returned during retrieval.\n\nDatabricks Vector Search\n\nComputing similarity is often computationally expensive, but vector indexes like Databricks Vector Search optimize this by efficiently organizing embeddings. Vector searches quickly rank the most relevant results without comparing each embedding to the user’s query individually.\n\nVector Search automatically syncs new embeddings added to your Delta table and updates the Vector Search index.\n\nWhat is a RAG agent?\n\nA Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) agent is a key part of a RAG application that enhances the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by integrating external data retrieval. The RAG agent processes user queries, retrieves relevant data from a vector database, and passes this data to an LLM to generate a response.\n\nTools like LangChain or Pyfunc link these steps by connecting their inputs and outputs.\n\nThe diagram below shows a RAG agent for a chatbot and the Databricks features used to build each agent.\n\nQuery preprocessing - A user submits a query, which is then preprocessed to make it suitable for querying the vector database. This may involve placing the request in a template or extracting keywords.\n\nQuery vectorization - Use Model Serving to embed the request using the same embedding model used to embed the chunks in the data pipeline. These embeddings enable comparison of the semantic similarity between the request and the preprocessed chunks.\n\nRetrieval phase - The retriever, an application responsible for fetching relevant information, takes the vectorized query and performs a vector similarity search using Vector Search. The most relevant data chunks are ranked and retrieved based on their similarity to the query.\n\nPrompt augmentation - The retriever combines the retrieved data chunks with the original query to provide additional context to the LLM. The prompt is carefully structured to ensure that the LLM understands the context of the query. Often, the LLM has a template for formatting the response. This process of adjusting the prompt is known as prompt engineering.\n\nLLM Generation phase - The LLM generates a response using the augmented query enriched by the retrieval results. The LLM can be a custom model or a foundation model.\n\nPost-processing - The LLM’s response may be processed to apply additional business logic, add citations, or otherwise refine the generated text based on predefined rules or constraints\n\nVarious guardrails may be applied throughout this process to ensure compliance with enterprise policies. This might involve filtering for appropriate requests, checking user permissions before accessing data sources, and using content moderation techniques on the generated responses.\n\nProduction-level RAG agent development\n\nQuickly iterate on agent development using the following features:\n\nCreate and log agents using any library and MLflow. Parameterize your agents to experiment and iterate on agent development quickly.\n\nDeploy agents to production with native support for token streaming and request/response logging, plus a built-in review app to get user feedback for your agent.\n\nAgent tracing lets you log, analyze, and compare traces across your agent code to debug and understand how your agent responds to requests.\n\nEvaluation & monitoring\n\nEvaluation and monitoring help determine if your RAG application meets your quality, cost, and latency requirements. Evaluation occurs during development, while monitoring happens once the application is deployed to production.\n\nRAG over unstructured data has many components that impact quality. For example, data formatting changes can influence the retrieved chunks and the LLM’s ability to generate relevant responses. So, it’s important to evaluate individual components in addition to the overall application.\n\nFor more information, see What is Mosaic AI Agent Evaluation?.\n\nRegion availability\n\nFor regional availability of Agent Framework, see Features with limited regional availability\n\n© Databricks 2025.

This article explains how to ensure your AI agent adheres to those requirements and how to customize your agent’s input and output schema while ensuring compatibility.\n\nMosaic AI uses MLflow Model Signatures to define an agent’s input and output schema requirements. The model signature tells internal and external components how to interact with your agent and validates that they adhere to the schema.\n\nOpenAI chat completion schema (recommended)\n\nDatabricks recommends using the OpenAI chat completion schema to define agent input and output. This schema is widely adopted and compatible with many agent frameworks and applications, including those in Databricks.\n\nSee OpenAI documentation for more information about the chat completion input schema and output schema.\n\nNote\n\nThe OpenAI chat completion schema is simply a standard for structuring agent inputs and outputs. Implementing this schema does not involve using OpenAI’s resources or models.\n\nMLflow provides convenient APIs for LangChain and PyFunc-flavored agents, helping you create agents compatible with the chat completion schema.\n\nImplement chat completion with LangChain\n\nIf your agent uses LangChain, use MLflow’s ChatCompletionOutputParser() to format your agent’s final output to be compatible with the chat completion schema. If you use LangGraph, see LangGraph custom schemas.\n\nCopy\nPython\n\n  from mlflow.langchain.output_parsers import ChatCompletionOutputParser\n\n  chain = (\n      {\n          \"user_query\": itemgetter(\"messages\")\n          | RunnableLambda(extract_user_query_string),\n          \"chat_history\": itemgetter(\"messages\") | RunnableLambda(extract_chat_history),\n      }\n      | RunnableLambda(DatabricksChat)\n      | ChatCompletionOutputParser()\n  )\n\nImplement chat completion with PyFunc\n\nIf you use PyFunc, Databricks recommends writing your agent as a subclass of mlflow.pyfunc.ChatModel. This method provides the following benefits:\n\nAllows you to write agent code compatible with the chat completion schema using typed Python classes.\n\nWhen logging the agent, MLflow will automatically infer a chat completion-compatible signature, even without an input_example. This simplifies the process of registering and deploying the agent. See Infer Model Signature during logging.\n\nCopy\nPython\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\nfrom typing import Optional, Dict, List, Generator\nfrom mlflow.pyfunc import ChatModel\nfrom mlflow.types.llm import (\n    # Non-streaming helper classes\n    ChatCompletionRequest,\n    ChatCompletionResponse,\n    ChatCompletionChunk,\n    ChatMessage,\n    ChatChoice,\n    ChatParams,\n    # Helper classes for streaming agent output\n    ChatChoiceDelta,\n    ChatChunkChoice,\n)\n\nclass MyAgent(ChatModel):\n    \"\"\"\n    Defines a custom agent that processes ChatCompletionRequests\n    and returns ChatCompletionResponses.\n    \"\"\"\n    def predict(self, context, messages: list[ChatMessage], params: ChatParams) -> ChatCompletionResponse:\n        last_user_question_text = messages[-1].content\n        response_message = ChatMessage(\n            role=\"assistant\",\n            content=(\n                f\"I will always echo back your last question.

Learn what makes an AI application a compound AI system and an AI agent.\n\nCompound AI systems\n\nCompound AI systems are systems that tackle AI tasks by combining multiple interacting components. In contrast, an AI model is simply a statistical model, e.g., a Transformer that predicts the next token in text. Compound AI systems are an increasingly common design pattern for AI applications due to their performance and flexibility.\n\nFor more information, see The Shift from Models to Compound AI Systems .\n\nWhat are AI agents?\n\nThe industry is still defining AI agents, however it generally understood as an AI system where the model makes some or all of the planning decisions in contrast to hard-coded logic. These agents use large language models (LLMs) to make decisions and accomplish their objectives.\n\nMany AI agents applications are made of multiple systems, thus qualifying them as compound AI systems.\n\nAgency is a continuum, the more freedom we provide models to control the behavior of the system, the more agent-like the application becomes.\n\nWhat are tools?\n\nAI agents use tools to perform actions besides language generation, for example to retrieve structured or unstructured data, run code, or talk to remote services like sending an email or Slack message.\n\nOn Databricks, you can use Unity Catalog functions as tools, enabling easy discovery, governance, and sharing of tools. You can also define tools using open source agent authoring libraries like LangChain.\n\nIn typical agentic workflows, the agent LLM is given metadata about tools, which it uses to determine when and how to use the tool. So when defining tools, you must ensure that the tool, its parameters, and its return value are well-documented, so that the agent LLM can best use the tool.\n\nFrom LLMs to AI agents\n\nTo understand AI agents, it’s helpful to consider the evolution of AI systems.\n\nLLMs: Initially, large language models simply responded to prompts based on knowledge from a vast training dataset.\n\nLLMs + tool chains: Then, developers added hardcoded tools to expand the LLM’s capabilities. For example, retrieval augmented generation (RAG) expanded an LLM’s knowledge base with custom documentation sets, while API tools allowed LLMs to perform tasks like create support tickets or send emails.\n\nAI agents: Now, AI agents autonomously create plans and execute tasks based on their understanding of the problem. AI agents still use tools but it’s up to them to decide which tool to use and when. The key distinction is in the level of autonomy and decision-making capabilities compared to compound AI systems.\n\nFrom a development standpoint, AI applications, whether they are individual LLMs, LLMs with toolchains, or full AI agents face similar challenges. Mosaic AI Agent Framework helps developers manage the unique challenges of building and AI applications at all levels of complexity.\n\nExamples of AI agents\n\nHere are some examples of AI agents across industries:\n\nAI/BI: AI-powered chatbots and dashboards accept natural language prompts to perform analysis on a businesses’ data, drawing insights from the full lifecycle of their data. AI/BI agents parse requests, decide which data sources to, and how to communicate findings. AI/BI agents can improve over time through human feedback, offering tools to verify and refine its outputs.\n\nCustomer service: AI-powered chatbots, such as those used by customer service platforms, interact with users, understand natural language, and provide relevant responses or perform tasks. Companies use AI chatbots for customer service by answering queries, providing product information, and assisting with troubleshooting.\n\nManufacturing predictive maintenance: AI agents can go beyond simply predicting equipment failures, autonomously acting on them by ordering replacements, or scheduling maintenance to reduce downtime and increase productivity.\n\nNext steps\n\nLearn how to develop and evaluate AI agents:\n\nCreate an AI agent\n\nWhat is Mosaic AI Agent Evaluation?\n\nHands on AI agent tutorials:\n\nDemo: Mosaic AI Agent Framework and Agent Evaluation\n\nIntroduction: End-to-end generative AI agent tutorial\n\n© Databricks 2025.

Logging an agent is the basis of the development process. Logging captures a “point in time” of the agent’s code and configuration so you can evaluate the quality of the configuration.\n\nRequirements\n\nCreate an AI agent before logging it.\n\nCode-based logging\n\nDatabricks recommends using MLflow’s Models from Code functionality when logging agents.\n\nIn this approach, the agent’s code is captured as a Python file, and the Python environment is captured as a list of packages. When the agent is deployed, the Python environment is restored, and the agent’s code is executed to load the agent into memory so it can be invoked when the endpoint is called.\n\nYou can couple this approach with the use of pre-deployment validation APIs like mlflow.models.predict() to ensure that the agent runs reliably when deployed for serving.\n\nThe code that logs the agent or agent must be in a separate notebook from the agent code. This notebook is called a driver notebook. For an example notebook, see Example notebooks.\n\nInfer Model Signature during logging\n\nDuring logging, you must define an MLflow Model Signature, which specifies the agent’s input and output schema. The signature validates inputs and outputs to ensure that the agent interacts correctly with downstream tools like AI Playground and the review app. It also guides other applications on how to use the agent effectively.\n\nDatabricks recommends using MLflow’s Model Signature inferencing capabilities to automatically generate the agent’s signature based on an input example you provide. This approach is more convenient than manually defining the signature.\n\nThe LangChain and PyFunc examples below use Model Signature inferencing.\n\nIf you would rather explicitly define a Model Signature yourself at logging time, see MLflow docs - How to log models with signatures.\n\nCode-based logging with LangChain\n\nThe following instructions and code sample show you how to log an agent with LangChain.\n\nCreate a notebook or Python file with your code. For this example, the notebook or file is named agent.py. The notebook or file must contain a LangChain agent, referred to here as lc_agent.\n\nInclude mlflow.models.set_model(lc_agent) in the notebook or file.\n\nCreate a new notebook to serve as the driver notebook (called driver.py in this example).\n\nIn the driver notebook, use the following code to run agent.py and log the results to an MLflow model:\n\nCopy\nPython\nmlflow.langchain.log_model(lc_model=\"/path/to/agent.py\", resources=list_of_databricks_resources)\n\n\nThe resources parameter declares Databricks-managed resources needed to serve the agent, such as a vector search index or serving endpoint that serves a foundation model. For more information, see Specify resources for automatic authentication passthrough.\n\nDeploy the model. See Deploy an agent for generative AI application.\n\nWhen the serving environment is loaded, agent.py is executed.\n\nWhen a serving request comes in, lc_agent.invoke(...) is called.\n\nCopy\nPython\n\nimport mlflow\n\ncode_path = \"/Workspace/Users/first.last/agent.py\"\nconfig_path = \"/Workspace/Users/first.last/config.yml\"\n\n# Input example used by MLflow to infer Model Signature\ninput_example = {\n    \"messages\": [\n        {\n            \"role\": \"user\",\n            \"content\": \"What is Retrieval-augmented Generation?\",\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\n# example using langchain\nwith mlflow.start_run():\n  logged_agent_info = mlflow.langchain.log_model(\n    lc_model=code_path,\n    model_config=config_path, # If you specify this parameter, this configuration is used by agent code. The development_config is overwritten.\n    artifact_path=\"agent\", # This string is used as the path inside the MLflow model where artifacts are stored\n    input_example=input_example, # Must be a valid input to the agent\n    example_no_conversion=True, # Required\n  )\n\nprint(f\"MLflow Run: {logged_agent_info.run_id}\")\nprint(f\"Model URI: {logged_agent_info.model_uri}\")\n\n# To verify that the model has been logged correctly, load the agent and call `invoke`:\nmodel = mlflow.langchain.load_model(logged_agent_info.model_uri)\nmodel.invoke(example)\n\nCode-based logging with PyFunc\n\nThe following instructions and code sample show you how to log an agent with PyFunc.\n\nCreate a notebook or Python file with your code. For this example, the notebook or file is named agent.py. The notebook or file must contain a PyFunc class, named PyFuncClass.\n\nInclude mlflow.models.set_model(PyFuncClass) in the notebook or file.\n\nCreate a new notebook to serve as the driver notebook (called driver.py in this example).\n\nIn the driver notebook, use the following code to run agent.py and log the results to an MLflow model:\n\nCopy\nPython\nmlflow.pyfunc.log_model(python_model=\"/path/to/agent.py\", resources=list_of_databricks_resources)\n\n\nThe resources parameter declares Databricks-managed resources needed to serve the agent, such as a vector search index or serving endpoint that serves a foundation model. For more information, see Specify resources for automatic authentication passthrough.\n\nDeploy the model. See Deploy an agent for generative AI application.\n\nWhen the serving environment is loaded, agent.py is executed.\n\nWhen a serving request comes in, PyFuncClass.predict(...) is called.\n\nCopy\nPython\nimport mlflow\nfrom mlflow.models.resources import (\n    DatabricksServingEndpoint,\n    DatabricksVectorSearchIndex,\n)\n\ncode_path = \"/Workspace/Users/first.last/agent.py\"\nconfig_path = \"/Workspace/Users/first.last/config.yml\"\n\n# Input example used by MLflow to infer Model Signature\ninput_example = {\n    \"messages\": [\n        {\n            \"role\": \"user\",\n            \"content\": \"What is Retrieval-augmented Generation?\",\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nwith mlflow.start_run():\n  logged_agent_info = mlflow.pyfunc.log_model(\n    python_model=agent_notebook_path,\n    artifact_path=\"agent\",\n    input_example=input_example,\n    resources=resources_path,\n    example_no_conversion=True,\n    resources=[\n      DatabricksServingEndpoint(endpoint_name=\"databricks-mixtral-8x7b-instruct\"),\n      DatabricksVectorSearchIndex(index_name=\"prod.agents.databricks_docs_index\"),\n    ]\n  )\n\nprint(f\"MLflow Run: {logged_agent_info.run_id}\")\nprint(f\"Model URI: {logged_agent_info.model_uri}\")\n\n# To verify that the model has been logged correctly, load the agent and call `invoke`:\nmodel = mlflow.pyfunc.load_model(logged_agent_info.model_uri)\nmodel.invoke(example)\n\nSpecify resources for automatic authentication passthrough\n\nAI agents often need to authenticate to other resources to complete tasks. For example, an agent may need to access a Vector Search index to query unstructured data.\n\nAs described in Authentication for dependent resources, Model Serving supports authenticating to both Databricks-managed and external resources when you deploy the agent.\n\nFor the most common Databricks resource types, Databricks supports and recommends declaring resource dependencies for the agent upfront during logging. This enables automatic authentication passthrough when you deploy the agent - Databricks automatically provisions, rotates, and manages short-lived credentials to securely access these resource dependencies from within the agent endpoint.\n\nTo enable automatic authentication passthrough, specify dependent resources using the resources parameter of the log_model() API, as shown in the following code.\n\nCopy\nPython\nimport mlflow\nfrom mlflow.models.resources import (\n    DatabricksVectorSearchIndex,\n    DatabricksServingEndpoint,\n    DatabricksSQLWarehouse,\n    DatabricksFunction,\n    DatabricksGenieSpace,\n    DatabricksTable,\n)\n\nwith mlflow.start_run():\n  logged_agent_info = mlflow.pyfunc.log_model(\n    python_model=agent_notebook_path,\n    artifact_path=\"agent\",\n    input_example=input_example,\n    example_no_conversion=True,\n    # Specify resources for automatic authentication passthrough\n    resources=[\n      DatabricksVectorSearchIndex(index_name=\"prod.agents.databricks_docs_index\"),\n      DatabricksServingEndpoint(endpoint_name=\"databricks-mixtral-8x7b-instruct\"),\n      DatabricksServingEndpoint(endpoint_name=\"databricks-bge-large-en\"),\n      DatabricksSQLWarehouse(warehouse_id=\"your_warehouse_id\"),\n      DatabricksFunction(function_name=\"ml.tools.python_exec\"),\n      DatabricksGenieSpace(genie_space_id=\"your_genie_space_id\"),\n      DatabricksTable(table_name=\"your_table_name\"),\n    ]\n  )\n\n\nDatabricks recommends you manually specify resources for all agent flavors.\n\nNote\n\nIf you do not specify resources when logging LangChain agents using mlflow.langchain.log_model(...), MLflow performs best-effort automatic inference of resources. However, this may not capture all dependencies, resulting in authorization errors when serving or querying the agent.\n\nThe following table lists the Databricks resources that support automatic authentication passthrough and the minimum mlflow version required to log the resource.\n\nResource type\n\n\t\n\nMinimum mlflow version required to log the resource\n\n\n\n\nVector Search index\n\n\t\n\nRequires mlflow 2.13.1 or above\n\n\n\n\nModel serving endpoint\n\n\t\n\nRequires mlflow 2.13.1 or above\n\n\n\n\nSQL warehouse\n\n\t\n\nRequires mlflow 2.16.1 or above\n\n\n\n\nUnity Catalog function\n\n\t\n\nRequires mlflow 2.16.1 or above\n\n\n\n\nGenie space\n\n\t\n\nRequires mlflow 2.17.1 or above\n\n\n\n\nUnity Catalog table\n\n\t\n\nRequires mlflow 2.18.0 or above\n\nRegister the agent to Unity Catalog\n\nBefore you deploy the agent, you must register the agent to Unity Catalog. Registering the agent packages it as a model in Unity Catalog. As a result, you can use Unity Catalog permissions for authorization for resources in the agent.\n\nCopy\nPython\nimport mlflow\n\nmlflow.set_registry_uri(\"databricks-uc\")\n\ncatalog_name = \"test_catalog\"\nschema_name = \"schema\"\nmodel_name = \"agent_name\"\n\nmodel_name = catalog_name + \".\" + schema_name + \".\" + model_name\nuc_model_info = mlflow.register_model(model_uri=logged_agent_info.model_uri, name=model_name)\n\nNext steps\n\nAdd traces to an AI agent.\n\nDeploy an AI agent.\n\n© Databricks 2025.

Once you’re done prototyping the agent, export the Python code that defines the agent to iterate and deploy your AI agent.\n\nRequirements\n\nUnderstand the concepts of AI agents and tools as described in What are compound AI systems and AI agents?\n\nDatabricks recommends installing the latest version of the MLflow Python client when developing agents.\n\nCreate AI agent tools\n\nThe first step is to create a tool to give to your agent. Agents use tools to perform actions besides language generation, for example to retrieve structured or unstructured data, execute code, or talk to remote services (e.g. send an email or Slack message).\n\nFor this guide, you can use the built-in Unity Catalog function, system.ai.python_exec, to give your agent the ability to execute arbitrary Python code.\n\nTo learn more about creating your own agent tools, see Create AI agent tools.\n\nPrototype tool-calling agents in AI Playground\n\nNow that you have tool, use the AI Playground to give the tool to an agent and interact with it to validate and test behavior. The AI Playground provides a sandbox to prototype tool-calling agents.\n\nNote\n\nUnity Catalog, and serverless compute, Mosaic AI Agent Framework, and either pay-per-token foundation models or external models must be available in the current workspace to prototype agents in AI Playground.\n\nTo prototype a tool-calling endpoint.\n\nFrom Playground, select a model with the Tools enabled label.\n\nSelect Tools and specify your Unity Catalog function names in the dropdown:\n\nChat to test out the current combination of LLM, tools, and system prompt, and try variations.\n\nExport and deploy AI Playground agents\n\nAfter prototyping and refining the AI agent in AI Playground, you can export it to Python notebooks for further development or deploy it directly as a Model Serving endpoint\n\nClick Export to generate Python notebooks that help you develop and deploy the AI agent.\n\nAfter exporting the agent code, you see three files saved to your workspace:\n\nagent notebook: Contains Python code defining your agent using LangChain.\n\ndriver notebook: Contains Python code to log, trace, register, and deploy the AI agent using Mosaic AI Agent Framework.\n\nconfig.yml: Contains configuration information about your agent including tool definitions.\n\nOpen the agent notebook to see the LangChain code defining your agent, use this notebook to test and iterate on the agent programmatically such as defining more tools or adjusting the agent’s parameters.\n\nNote\n\nThe exported code might have different behavior from your AI playground session. Databricks recommends that you run the exported notebooks to iterate and debug further, evaluate agent quality, and then deploy the agent to share with others.\n\nOnce you’re happy with the agent’s outputs, you can run the driver notebook to log and deploy your agent to a Model Serving endpoint.\n\nDefine an agent in code\n\nIn addition to generating agent code from AI Playground, you can also define an agent in code yourself, using frameworks like LangChain or Python code. In order to deploy an agent using Agent Framework, its input must conform to one of the supported input and output formats.\n\nUse parameters to configure the agent\n\nIn the Agent Framework, you can use parameters to control how agents are executed. This allows you to quickly iterate by varying characteristics of your agent without changing the code. Parameters are key-value pairs that you define in a Python dictionary or a .yaml file.\n\nTo configure the code, create a ModelConfig, a set of key-value parameters. ModelConfig is either a Python dictionary or a .yaml file. For example, you can use a dictionary during development and then convert it to a .yaml file for production deployment and CI/CD. For details about ModelConfig, see the MLflow documentation.\n\nAn example ModelConfig is shown below.\n\nCopy\nYAML\nllm_parameters:\n  max_tokens: 500\n  temperature: 0.01\nmodel_serving_endpoint: databricks-dbrx-instruct\nvector_search_index: ml.docs.databricks_docs_index\nprompt_template: 'You are a hello world bot. Respond with a reply to the user''s\n  question that indicates your prompt template came from a YAML file. Your response\n  must use the word \"YAML\" somewhere. User''s question: {question}'\nprompt_template_input_vars:\n- question\n\n\nTo call the configuration from your code, use one of the following:\n\nCopy\nPython\n# Example for loading from a .yml file\nconfig_file = \"configs/hello_world_config.yml\"\nmodel_config = mlflow.models.ModelConfig(development_config=config_file)\n\n# Example of using a dictionary\nconfig_dict = {\n    \"prompt_template\": \"You are a hello world bot. Respond with a reply to the user's question that is fun and interesting to the user. User's question: {question}\",\n    \"prompt_template_input_vars\": [\"question\"],\n    \"model_serving_endpoint\": \"databricks-dbrx-instruct\",\n    \"llm_parameters\": {\"temperature\": 0.01, \"max_tokens\": 500},\n}\n\nmodel_config = mlflow.models.ModelConfig(development_config=config_dict)\n\n# Use model_config.get() to retrieve a parameter value\nvalue = model_config.get('sample_param')\n\nSet retriever schema\n\nAI agents often use retrievers, a type of agent tool that finds and returns relevant documents using a Vector Search index. For more information on retrievers, see Unstructured retrieval AI agent tools.\n\nTo ensure that retrievers are traced properly, call mlflow.models.set_retriever_schema when you define your agent in code. Use set_retriever_schema to map the column names in the returned table to MLflow’s expected fields such as primary_key, text_column, and doc_uri.\n\nCopy\nPython\n# Define the retriever's schema by providing your column names\n# These strings should be read from a config dictionary\nmlflow.models.set_retriever_schema(\n    name=\"vector_search\",\n    primary_key=\"chunk_id\",\n    text_column=\"text_column\",\n    doc_uri=\"doc_uri\"\n    # other_columns=[\"column1\", \"column2\"],\n)\n\n\nNote\n\nThe doc_uri column is especially important when evaluating the retriever’s performance. doc_uri is the main identifier for documents returned by the retriever, allowing you to compare them against ground truth evaluation sets. See Evaluation sets\n\nYou can also specify additional columns in your retriever’s schema by providing a list of column names with the other_columns field.\n\nIf you have multiple retrievers, you can define multiple schemas by using unique names for each retriever schema.\n\nSupported input and output formats\n\nAgent Framework uses MLflow Model Signatures to define input and output schemas for agents. Mosaic AI Agent Framework features require a minimum set of input/output fields to interact with features such as the Review App and the AI Playground. For more information, see Define an agent’s input and output schema.\n\nExample notebooks\n\nThese notebooks create a simple “Hello, world” chain to illustrate how to create a chain application in Databricks. The first example creates a simple chain. The second example notebook illustrates how to use parameters to minimize code changes during development.\n\nSimple chain notebook\n\nOpen notebook in new tab\n Copy link for import\n\nLoading notebook...\nSimple chain driver notebook\n\nOpen notebook in new tab\n Copy link for import\n\nLoading notebook...\nParameterized chain notebook\n\nOpen notebook in new tab\n Copy link for import\n\nLoading notebook...\nParameterized chain driver notebook\n\nOpen notebook in new tab\n Copy link for import\n\nLoading notebook...\nNext steps\n\nLog an AI agent.\n\nAdd traces to an AI agent.\n\nDeploy an AI agent.\n\n© Databricks 2025.

Writing your tool as a Unity Catalog function grants easier discoverability, governance, and reuse. Unity Catalog functions work especially well for applying transformations and aggregations on large datasets.\n\nAgent code tools: These tools are defined in the same code that defines the AI agent. This approach is useful when calling REST APIs, using arbitrary code or libraries, or executing low-latency tools. However, this approach lacks the built-in discoverability and governance provided by Unity Catalog functions.\n\nBoth methods are compatible with agents written in custom Python code or using agent-authoring libraries like LangGraph.\n\nTo see examples of Unity Catalog function tools and agent code tools, see Agent tool examples\n\nImprove tool-calling with documentation\n\nClear and detailed documentation helps AI agents understand when and how to use the tools you provide. When creating tools, document tool parameters and return values thoroughly to ensure that your AI agent uses the tools correctly and at the right time:\n\nFor Unity Catalog functions, use COMMENT to describe the tool and parameters.\n\nExample of effective tool documentation\n\nThe following example shows effective COMMENT strings for a Unity Catalog function tool that queries a structured table.\n\nCopy\nSQL\nCREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION main.default.lookup_customer_info(\n  customer_name STRING COMMENT 'Name of the customer whose info to look up.'\n)\nRETURNS STRING\nCOMMENT 'Returns metadata about a specific customer including their email and ID.'\nRETURN SELECT CONCAT(\n    'Customer ID: ', customer_id, ', ',\n    'Customer Email: ', customer_email\n  )\n  FROM main.default.customer_data\n  WHERE customer_name = customer_name\n  LIMIT 1;\n\nExample of ineffective tool documentation\n\nThe following example shows ineffective COMMENT strings that miss key information, such as the return values.\n\nCopy\nSQL\nCREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION main.default.lookup_customer_info(\n  customer_name STRING COMMENT 'Name of the customer.'\n)\nRETURNS STRING\nCOMMENT 'Returns info about a customer.'\nRETURN SELECT CONCAT(\n    'Customer ID: ', customer_id, ', ',\n    'Customer Email: ', customer_email\n  )\n  FROM main.default.customer_data\n  WHERE customer_name = customer_name\n  LIMIT 1;\n\nAgent tool examples\n\nSee the following articles for examples of agent tools:\n\nCode interpreter tools allow agents to execute arbitrary code such as Python.\n\nStructured data retrieval tools allow your agent to query structured data sources like SQL tables.\n\nUnstructured data retrieval tools allow your agent to query unstructured data sources like a text corpora to perform retrieval augmented generation.\n\nAdd Unity Catalog tools to agents\n\nOnce you create the Unity Catalog tools, add them to your agent. LangChain agents can leverage the UCFunctionToolkit to incorporate UC tools.\n\nExport tool-calling agents from the AI Playground\n\nThe AI Playground provides a convenient way to add Unity Catalog tools to an LLM, test the agent, and export its code.\n\nTo use the AI Playground to export agents, your workspace must meet the following requirements:\n\nUnity Catalog must be enabled.\n\nServerless compute must be enabled.\n\nEither Pay-per-token foundation models or External models must be enabled.\n\nUse the following steps to export tool-calling agents code:\n\nFrom the AI Playground, select a model with the Tools enabled label.\n\nSelect Tools and click Add a tool.\n\nIn the dropdown menu, select a Unity Catalog function:\n\nUse the Playground to chat and test the current combination of LLM, tools, and system prompt. Try variations to get a feel for how the current setup works.\n\nAfter adding tools, export the agent to Python notebooks:\n\nClick Export to generate Python notebooks that define and deploy the agent.\n\nAfter exporting the agent code, you will see three files saved to your workspace:\n\nagent notebook: Contains Python code defining your agent using LangChain.\n\ndriver notebook: Contains Python code to log, trace, register, and deploy the AI agent using Mosaic AI Agent Framework.\n\nconfig.yml: Contains configuration information about your agent, including tool definitions.\n\nOpen the agent notebook to see the LangChain code defining your agent. Use this notebook to test and iterate on the agent programmatically, such as defining more tools.\n\nWhen you’re happy with the agent’s outputs, run the driver notebook to log and deploy your agent to a Model Serving endpoint.\n\nNext steps\n\nTrace an agent.\n\n© Databricks 2025.

For an overview, see the deep learning inference workflow.\n\nTypically there are two main parts in model inference: data input pipeline and model inference. The data input pipeline is heavy on data I/O input and model inference is heavy on computation. Determining the bottleneck of the workflow is simple. Here are some approaches:\n\nReduce the model to a trivial model and measure the examples per second. If the difference of the end to end time between the full model and the trivial model is minimal, then the data input pipeline is likely a bottleneck, otherwise model inference is the bottleneck.\n\nIf running model inference with GPU, check the GPU utilization metrics. If GPU utilization is not continuously high, then the data input pipeline may be the bottleneck.\n\nOptimize data input pipeline\n\nUsing GPUs can efficiently optimize the running speed for model inference. As GPUs and other accelerators become faster, it is important that the data input pipeline keep up with demand. The data input pipeline reads the data into Spark Dataframes, transforms it, and loads it as the input for model inference. If data input is the bottleneck, here are some tips to increase I/O throughput:\n\nSet the max records per batch. Larger number of max records can reduce the I/O overhead to call the UDF function as long as the records can fit in memory. To set the batch size, set the following config:\n\nCopy\nPython\nspark.conf.set(\"spark.sql.execution.arrow.maxRecordsPerBatch\", \"5000\")\n\n\nLoad the data in batches and prefetch it when preprocessing the input data in the pandas UDF.\n\nFor TensorFlow, Databricks recommends using the tf.data API. You can parse the map in parallel by setting num_parallel_calls in a map function and call prefetch and batch for prefetching and batching.\n\nCopy\nPython\ndataset.map(parse_example, num_parallel_calls=num_process).prefetch(prefetch_size).batch(batch_size)\n\n\nFor PyTorch, Databricks recommends using the DataLoader class. You can set batch_size for batching and num_workers for parallel data loading.\n\nCopy\nPython\ntorch.utils.data.DataLoader(images, batch_size=batch_size, num_workers=num_process)\n\n\n© Databricks 2025.

For example notebooks that use TensorFlow and PyTorch, see Deep learning model inference examples.\n\nLoad the data into Spark DataFrames. Depending on the data type, Databricks recommends the following ways to load data:\n\nImage files (JPG,PNG): Load the image paths into a Spark DataFrame. Image loading and preprocessing input data occurs in a pandas UDF.\n\nCopy\nPython\nfiles_df = spark.createDataFrame(map(lambda path: (path,), file_paths), [\"path\"])\n\n\nTFRecords: Load the data using the spark-tensorflow-connector.\n\nCopy\nPython\ndf = spark.read.format(\"tfrecords\").load(image_path)\n\n\nData sources such as Parquet, CSV, JSON, JDBC, and other metadata: Load the data using Spark data sources.\n\nPerform model inference using pandas UDFs. pandas UDFs use Apache Arrow to transfer data and pandas to work with the data. To do model inference, the following are the broad steps in the workflow with pandas UDFs.\n\nLoad the trained model: For efficiency, Databricks recommends broadcasting the weights of the model from the driver and loading the model graph and get the weights from the broadcasted variables in a pandas UDF.\n\nLoad and preprocess input data: To load data in batches, Databricks recommends using the tf.data API for TensorFlow and the DataLoader class for PyTorch. Both also support prefetching and multi-threaded loading to hide IO bound latency.\n\nRun model prediction: run model inference on the data batch.\n\nSend predictions back to Spark DataFrames: collect the prediction results and return as pd.Series.\n\nDeep learning model inference examples\n\nThe examples in this section follow the recommended deep learning inference workflow. These examples illustrate how to perform model inference using a pre-trained deep residual networks (ResNets) neural network model.\n\nModel inference using TensorFlow Keras API\nModel inference using TensorFlow and TensorRT\nModel inference using PyTorch\n\n© Databricks 2025.

You can query foundation models that are hosted by Databricks and foundation models hosted outside of Databricks.\n\nFor traditional ML or Python models query requests, see Query serving endpoints for custom models.\n\nMosaic AI Model Serving supports Foundation Models APIs and external models for accessing foundation models. Model Serving uses a unified OpenAI-compatible API and SDK for querying them. This makes it possible to experiment with and customize foundation models for production across supported clouds and providers.\n\nMosaic AI Model Serving provides the following options for sending scoring requests to endpoints that serve foundation models or external models:\n\nMethod\n\n\t\n\nDetails\n\n\n\n\nOpenAI client\n\n\t\n\nQuery a model hosted by a Mosaic AI Model Serving endpoint using the OpenAI client. Specify the model serving endpoint name as the model input. Supported for chat, embeddings, and completions models made available by Foundation Model APIs or external models.\n\n\n\n\nSQL function\n\n\t\n\nInvoke model inference directly from SQL using the ai_query SQL function. See Query a served model with ai_query.\n\n\n\n\nServing UI\n\n\t\n\nSelect Query endpoint from the Serving endpoint page. Insert JSON format model input data and click Send Request. If the model has an input example logged, use Show Example to load it.\n\n\n\n\nREST API\n\n\t\n\nCall and query the model using the REST API. See POST /serving-endpoints/{name}/invocations for details. For scoring requests to endpoints serving multiple models, see Query individual models behind an endpoint.\n\n\n\n\nMLflow Deployments SDK\n\n\t\n\nUse MLflow Deployments SDK’s predict() function to query the model.\n\n\n\n\nDatabricks Python SDK\n\n\t\n\nDatabricks Python SDK is a layer on top of the REST API. It handles low-level details, such as authentication, making it easier to interact with the models.\n\nRequirements\n\nA model serving endpoint.\n\nA Databricks workspace in a supported region.\n\nFoundation Model APIs regions\n\nExternal models regions\n\nTo send a scoring request through the OpenAI client, REST API or MLflow Deployment SDK, you must have a Databricks API token.\n\nImportant\n\nAs a security best practice for production scenarios, Databricks recommends that you use machine-to-machine OAuth tokens for authentication during production.\n\nFor testing and development, Databricks recommends using a personal access token belonging to service principals instead of workspace users. To create tokens for service principals, see Manage tokens for a service principal.\n\nInstall packages\n\nAfter you have selected a querying method, you must first install the appropriate package to your cluster.\n\nOpenAI client\nREST API\nMLflow Deployments SDK\nDatabricks Python SDK\n\nTo use the OpenAI client, the databricks-sdk[openai] package needs to be installed on your cluster. Databricks SDK provides a wrapper for constructing the OpenAI client with authorization automatically configured to query generative AI models. Run the following in your notebook or your local terminal:\n\nCopy\n!pip install databricks-sdk[openai]>=0.35.0\n\n\nThe following is only required when installing the package on a Databricks Notebook\n\nCopy\ndbutils.library.restartPython()\n\nQuery a chat completion model\n\nThe following are examples for querying a chat model. The example applies to querying a chat model made available using either of the Model Serving capabilities: Foundation Model APIs or External models.\n\nFor a batch inference example, see Perform batch LLM inference using ai_query.\n\nOpenAI client\nREST API\nMLflow Deployments SDK\nDatabricks Python SDK\nLangChain\nSQL\n\nThe following is a chat request for the DBRX Instruct model made available by the Foundation Model APIs pay-per-token endpoint, databricks-dbrx-instruct in your workspace.\n\nTo use the OpenAI client, specify the model serving endpoint name as the model input.\n\nCopy\n\nfrom databricks.sdk import WorkspaceClient\n\nw = WorkspaceClient()\nopenai_client = w.serving_endpoints.get_open_ai_client()\n\nresponse = openai_client.chat.completions.create(\n    model=\"databricks-dbrx-instruct\",\n    messages=[\n      {\n        \"role\": \"system\",\n        \"content\": \"You are a helpful assistant.\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"role\": \"user\",\n        \"content\": \"What is a mixture of experts model?\",\n      }\n    ],\n    max_tokens=256\n)\n\n\nTo query foundation models outside of your workspace, you must use the OpenAI client directly. You also need your Databricks workspace instance to connect the OpenAI client to Databricks. The following example assumes you have a Databricks API token and openai installed on your compute.\n\nCopy\n\nimport os\nimport openai\nfrom openai import OpenAI\n\nclient = OpenAI(\n    api_key=\"dapi-your-databricks-token\",\n    base_url=\"https://example.staging.cloud.databricks.com/serving-endpoints\"\n)\n\nresponse = client.chat.completions.create(\n    model=\"databricks-dbrx-instruct\",\n    messages=[\n      {\n        \"role\": \"system\",\n        \"content\": \"You are a helpful assistant.\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"role\": \"user\",\n        \"content\": \"What is a mixture of experts model?\",\n      }\n    ],\n    max_tokens=256\n)\n\n\nAs an example, the following is the expected request format for a chat model when using the REST API. For external models, you can include additional parameters that are valid for a given provider and endpoint configuration. See Additional query parameters.\n\nCopy\nBash\n{\n  \"messages\": [\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"What is a mixture of experts model?\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"max_tokens\": 100,\n  \"temperature\": 0.1\n}\n\n\nThe following is an expected response format for a request made using the REST API:\n\nCopy\nJSON\n{\n  \"model\": \"databricks-dbrx-instruct\",\n  \"choices\": [\n    {\n      \"message\": {},\n      \"index\": 0,\n      \"finish_reason\": null\n    }\n  ],\n  \"usage\": {\n    \"prompt_tokens\": 7,\n    \"completion_tokens\": 74,\n    \"total_tokens\": 81\n  },\n  \"object\": \"chat.completion\",\n  \"id\": null,\n  \"created\": 1698824353\n}\n\nQuery an embedding model\n\nThe following is an embeddings request for the gte-large-en model made available by Foundation Model APIs. The example applies to querying an embedding model made available using either of the Model Serving capabilities: Foundation Model APIs or external models.\n\nOpenAI client\nREST API\nMLflow Deployments SDK\nDatabricks Python SDK\nLangChain\nSQL\n\nTo use the OpenAI client, specify the model serving endpoint name as the model input.\n\nCopy\n\nfrom databricks.sdk import WorkspaceClient\n\nw = WorkspaceClient()\nopenai_client = w.serving_endpoints.get_open_ai_client()\n\nresponse = openai_client.embeddings.create(\n  model=\"databricks-gte-large-en\",\n  input=\"what is databricks\"\n)\n\n\nTo query foundation models outside your workspace, you must use the OpenAI client directly, as demonstrated below. The following example assumes you have a Databricks API token and openai installed on your compute. You also need your Databricks workspace instance to connect the OpenAI client to Databricks.\n\nCopy\n\nimport os\nimport openai\nfrom openai import OpenAI\n\nclient = OpenAI(\n    api_key=\"dapi-your-databricks-token\",\n    base_url=\"https://example.staging.cloud.databricks.com/serving-endpoints\"\n)\n\nresponse = client.embeddings.create(\n  model=\"databricks-gte-large-en\",\n  input=\"what is databricks\"\n)\n\n\nThe following is the expected request format for an embeddings model. For external models, you can include additional parameters that are valid for a given provider and endpoint configuration. See Additional query parameters.\n\nCopy\nBash\n{\n  \"input\": [\n    \"embedding text\"\n  ]\n}\n\n\nThe following is the expected response format:\n\nCopy\nJSON\n{\n  \"object\": \"list\",\n  \"data\": [\n    {\n      \"object\": \"embedding\",\n      \"index\": 0,\n      \"embedding\": []\n    }\n  ],\n  \"model\": \"text-embedding-ada-002-v2\",\n  \"usage\": {\n    \"prompt_tokens\": 2,\n    \"total_tokens\": 2\n  }\n}\n\nCheck if embeddings are normalized\n\nUse the following to check if the embeddings generated by your model are normalized.\n\nCopy\nPython\n\n  import numpy as np\n\n  def is_normalized(vector: list[float], tol=1e-3) -> bool:\n      magnitude = np.linalg.norm(vector)\n      return abs(magnitude - 1) < tol\n\nQuery a text completion model\nOpenAI client\nREST API\nMLflow Deployments SDK\nDatabricks Python SDK\nSQL\n\nImportant\n\nQuerying text completion models made available using Foundation Model APIs pay-per-token using the OpenAI client is not supported. Only querying external models using the OpenAI client is supported as demonstrated in this section.\n\nTo use the OpenAI client, specify the model serving endpoint name as the model input. The following example queries the claude-2 completions model hosted by Anthropic using the OpenAI client. To use the OpenAI client, populate the model field with the name of the model serving endpoint that hosts the model you want to query.\n\nThis example uses a previously created endpoint, anthropic-completions-endpoint, configured for accessing external models from the Anthropic model provider. See how to create external model endpoints.\n\nSee Supported models for additional models you can query and their providers.\n\nCopy\n\nfrom databricks.sdk import WorkspaceClient\n\nw = WorkspaceClient()\nopenai_client = w.serving_endpoints.get_open_ai_client()\n\ncompletion = openai_client.completions.create(\nmodel=\"anthropic-completions-endpoint\",\nprompt=\"what is databricks\",\ntemperature=1.0\n)\nprint(completion)\n\n\nThe following is the expected request format for a completions model.

Model Serving supports plain text environment variables and secrets-based environment variables using Databricks secrets.\n\nRequirements\n\nFor secrets-based environment variables,\n\nThe endpoint creator must have READ access to the Databricks secrets being referenced in the configs.\n\nYou must store credentials like your API key or other tokens as a Databricks secret.\n\nAdd plain text environment variables\n\nUse plain text environment variables to set variables that don’t need to be hidden. You can set variables in the Serving UI or the REST API when you create or update an endpoint.\n\nFrom the Serving UI, you can add an environment variable in Advanced configurations:\n\nThe following is an example for creating a serving endpoint using the POST /api/2.0/serving-endpoints REST API and the environment_vars field to configure your environment variable.\n\nCopy\nJSON\n{\n  \"name\": \"endpoint-name\",\n  \"config\":{\n   \"served_entities\": [{\n     \"entity_name\": \"model-name\",\n     \"entity_version\": \"1\",\n     \"workload_size\": \"Small\",\n     \"scale_to_zero_enabled\": \"true\",\n     \"environment_vars\":{\n        \"TEXT_ENV_VAR_NAME\": \"plain-text-env-value\"\n      }\n    }]\n  }\n}\n\nAdd secrets-based environment variables\n\nYou can securely store credentials using Databricks secrets and reference those secrets in model serving using a secrets-based environment variables. This allows credentials to be fetched from model serving endpoints at serving time.\n\nFor example, you can pass credentials to call OpenAI and other external model endpoints or access external data storage locations directly from model serving.\n\nDatabricks recommends this feature for deploying OpenAI and LangChain MLflow model flavors to serving. It is also applicable to other SaaS models requiring credentials with the understanding that the access pattern is based on using environment variables and API keys and tokens.\n\nStep 1: Create a secret scope\n\nDuring model serving, the secrets are retrieved from Databricks secrets by the secret scope and key. These get assigned to the secret environment variable names that can be used inside the model.\n\nFirst, create a secret scope. See Manage secret scopes.\n\nThe following are CLI commands:\n\nCopy\nBash\ndatabricks secrets create-scope my_secret_scope\n\n\nYou can then add your secret to a desired secret scope and key as shown below:\n\nCopy\nBash\ndatabricks secrets put-secret my_secret_scope my_secret_key\n\n\nThe secret information and the name of the environment variable can then be passed to your endpoint configuration during endpoint creation or as an update to the configuration of an existing endpoint.\n\nStep 2: Add secret scopes to endpoint configuration\n\nYou can add the secret scope to an environment variable and pass that variable to your endpoint during endpoint creation or configuration updates. See Create custom model serving endpoints.\n\nFrom the Serving UI, you can add an environment variable in Advanced configurations. The secrets based environment variable must be provided using the following syntax: {{secrets/scope/key}}. Otherwise, the environment variable is considered a plain text environment variable.\n\nThe following is an example for creating a serving endpoint using the REST API. During model serving endpoint creation and configuration updates, you are able to provide a list of secret environment variable specifications for each served model inside the API request using environment_vars field.\n\nThe following example assigns the value from the secret created in the provided code to the environment variable OPENAI_API_KEY.\n\nCopy\nJSON\n{\n  \"name\": \"endpoint-name\",\n  \"config\":{\n   \"served_entities\": [{\n     \"entity_name\": \"model-name\",\n     \"entity_version\": \"1\",\n     \"workload_size\": \"Small\",\n     \"scale_to_zero_enabled\": \"true\",\n     \"environment_vars\":{\n        \"OPENAI_API_KEY\": \"{{secrets/my_secret_scope/my_secret_key}}\"\n      }\n    }]\n   }\n}\n\n\nYou can also update a serving endpoint, as in the following PUT /api/2.0/serving-endpoints/{name}/config REST API example:\n\nCopy\nJSON\n{\n  \"served_entities\": [{\n    \"entity_name\": \"model-name\",\n    \"entity_version\": \"2\",\n    \"workload_size\": \"Small\",\n    \"scale_to_zero_enabled\": \"true\",\n    \"environment_vars\":{\n      \"OPENAI_API_KEY\": \"{{secrets/my_secret_scope/my_secret_key}}\"\n     }\n   }]\n}\n\n\nAfter the endpoint is created or updated, model serving automatically fetches the secret key from the Databricks secrets scope and populates the environment variable for your model inference code to use.\n\nNotebook example\n\nSee the following notebook for an example of how to configure an OpenAI API key for a LangChain Retrieval QA Chain deployed behind the model serving endpoints with secret-based environment variables.\n\nConfigure access to resources from model serving endpoints notebook\n\nOpen notebook in new tab\n Copy link for import\n\nLoading notebook...\nAdditional resource\n\nAdd an instance profile to a model serving endpoint\n\n© Databricks 2025.

The example in this article focuses on providing guidance for adding preprocessing and postprocessing logic to your model and deploying it.\n\nMLflow’s Python function, pyfunc, provides flexibility to deploy any piece of Python code or any Python model. The following are example scenarios where you might want to use the guide.\n\nYour model requires preprocessing before inputs can be passed to the model’s predict function.\n\nYour model framework is not natively supported by MLflow.\n\nYour application requires the model’s raw outputs to be post-processed for consumption.\n\nThe model itself has per-request branching logic.\n\nYou are looking to deploy fully custom code as a model.\n\nConstruct a custom MLflow Python function model\n\nMLflow offers the ability to log Python code with the custom Python models format.\n\nThere are two required functions when packaging arbitrary python code with MLflow:\n\nload_context - anything that needs to be loaded just one time for the model to operate should be defined in this function. This is critical so that the system minimize the number of artifacts loaded during the predict function, which speeds up inference.\n\npredict - this function houses all the logic that is run every time an input request is made.\n\nLog your Python function model\n\nEven though you are writing your model with custom code, it is possible to use shared modules of code from your organization. With the code_path parameter, authors of models can log full code references that load into the path and are usable from other custom pyfunc models.\n\nFor example, if a model is logged with:\n\nCopy\nPython\nmlflow.pyfunc.log_model(CustomModel(), \"model\", code_path = [\"preprocessing_utils/\"])\n\n\nCode from the preprocessing_utils is available in the loaded context of the model. The following is an example model that uses this code.\n\nCopy\nPython\nclass CustomModel(mlflow.pyfunc.PythonModel):\n    def load_context(self, context):\n        self.model = torch.load(context.artifacts[\"model-weights\"])\n        from preprocessing_utils.my_custom_tokenizer import CustomTokenizer\n        self.tokenizer = CustomTokenizer(context.artifacts[\"tokenizer_cache\"])\n\n    def format_inputs(self, model_input):\n        # insert some code that formats your inputs\n        pass\n\n    def format_outputs(self, outputs):\n        predictions = (torch.sigmoid(outputs)).data.numpy()\n        return predictions\n\n    def predict(self, context, model_input):\n        model_input = self.format_inputs(model_input)\n        outputs = self.model.predict(model_input)\n        return self.format_outputs(outputs)\n\nServe your model\n\nAfter you log your custom pyfunc model, you can register it to Unity Catalog or Workspace Registry and serve your model to a Model Serving endpoint.\n\nNotebook example\n\nThe following notebook example demonstrates how to customize model output when the raw output of the queried model needs to be post-processed for consumption.\n\nCustomize model serving output with MLflow PyFunc notebook\n\nOpen notebook in new tab\n Copy link for import\n\nLoading notebook...\n\n© Databricks 2025.

Models are also sometimes configured to download artifacts from the internet (such as HuggingFace Tokenizers). Real-time workloads at scale perform best when all required dependencies are statically captured at deployment time. For this reason, Model Serving requires that Unity Catalog volumes artifacts are packaged into the model artifact itself using MLflow interfaces. Network artifacts loaded with the model should be packaged with the model whenever possible.\n\nWith the MLflow command log_model() you can log a model and its dependent artifacts with the artifacts parameter.\n\nCopy\nPython\nmlflow.pyfunc.log_model(\n    ...\n    artifacts={'model-weights': \"/Volumes/catalog/schema/volume/path/to/file\", \"tokenizer_cache\": \"./tokenizer_cache\"},\n    ...\n)\n\n\nIn PyFunc models, these artifacts’ paths are accessible from the context object under context.artifacts, and they can be loaded in the standard way for that file type.\n\nFor example, in a custom MLflow model:\n\nCopy\nPython\nclass ModelPyfunc(mlflow.pyfunc.PythonModel):\n    def load_context(self, context):\n        self.model = torch.load(context.artifacts[\"model-weights\"])\n        self.tokenizer = transformers.BertweetTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"model-base\", local_files_only=True, cache_dir=context.artifacts[\"tokenizer_cache\"])\n    ...\n\n\nAfter your files and artifacts are packaged within your model artifact, you can serve your model to a Model Serving endpoint.\n\n© Databricks 2025.

You should complete the steps detailed in this guide after you have a trained ML model ready to deploy but before you create a Databricks Model Serving endpoint.\n\nModel development often requires the use of custom Python libraries that contain functions for pre- or post-processing, custom model definitions, and other shared utilities. In addition, many enterprise security teams encourage the use of private PyPi mirrors, such as Nexus or Artifactory, to reduce the risk of supply-chain attacks. Databricks offers native support for installation of custom libraries and libraries from a private mirror in the Databricks workspace.\n\nRequirements\n\nMLflow 1.29 or higher\n\nStep 1: Upload dependency file\n\nDatabricks recommends that you upload your dependency file to Unity Catalog volumes. Alternatively, you can upload it to Databricks File System (DBFS) using the Databricks UI.\n\nTo ensure your library is available to your notebook, you need to install it using %pip%. Using %pip installs the library in the current notebook and downloads the dependency to the cluster.\n\nStep 2: Log the model with a custom library\n\nImportant\n\nThe guidance in this section is not required if you install the private library by pointing to a custom PyPi mirror.\n\nAfter you install the library and upload the Python wheel file to either Unity Catalog volumes or DBFS, include the following code in your script. In the extra_pip_requirements specify the path of your dependency file.\n\nCopy\nPython\nmlflow.sklearn.log_model(model, \"sklearn-model\", extra_pip_requirements=[\"/volume/path/to/dependency.whl\"])\n\n\nFor DBFS, use the following:\n\nCopy\nPython\nmlflow.sklearn.log_model(model, \"sklearn-model\", extra_pip_requirements=[\"/dbfs/path/to/dependency.whl\"])\n\n\nIf you have a custom library, you must specify all custom Python libraries associated with your model when you configure logging. You can do so with the extra_pip_requirements or conda_env parameters in log_model().\n\nImportant\n\nIf using DBFS, be sure to include a forward slash, /, before your dbfs path when logging extra_pip_requirements. Learn more about DBFS paths in Work with files on Databricks.\n\nCopy\nPython\nfrom mlflow.utils.environment import _mlflow_conda_env\nconda_env =  _mlflow_conda_env(\n            additional_conda_deps= None,\n            additional_pip_deps= [\"/volumes/path/to/dependency\"],\n            additional_conda_channels=None,\n)\nmlflow.pyfunc.log_model(..., conda_env = conda_env)\n\nStep 3: Update MLflow model with Python wheel files\n\nMLflow provides the add_libraries_to_model() utility to log your model with all of its dependencies pre-packaged as Python wheel files. This packages your custom libraries alongside the model in addition to all other libraries that are specified as dependencies of your model. This guarantees that the libraries used by your model are exactly the ones accessible from your training environment.\n\nIn the following example, model_uri references the Unity Catalog model registry using the syntax models:/<uc-model>/<model-version>. To reference the workspace model registry (legacy) use, models:/<model-name>/<model-version>.\n\nWhen you use the model registry URI, this utility generates a new version under your existing registered model.\n\nCopy\nPython\nimport mlflow.models.utils\nmlflow.models.utils.add_libraries_to_model(<model-uri>)\n\nStep 4: Serve your model\n\nWhen a new model version with the packages included is available in the model registry, you can add this model version to an endpoint with Model Serving.\n\n© Databricks 2025.

The guidance is relevant to serving custom models, which Databricks defines as traditional ML models or customized Python models packaged in the MLflow format. They can be registered either in Unity Catalog or in the workspace model registry. Examples include scikit-learn, XGBoost, PyTorch, and Hugging Face transformer models. See Deploy models using Mosaic AI Model Serving for more information about this functionality and supported model categories.\n\nFor query requests for generative AI and LLM workloads, see Query foundation models.\n\nRequirements\n\nA model serving endpoint.\n\nFor the MLflow Deployment SDK, MLflow 2.9 or above is required.\n\nScoring request in an accepted format.\n\nTo send a scoring request through the REST API or MLflow Deployment SDK, you must have a Databricks API token.\n\nImportant\n\nAs a security best practice for production scenarios, Databricks recommends that you use machine-to-machine OAuth tokens for authentication during production.\n\nFor testing and development, Databricks recommends using a personal access token belonging to service principals instead of workspace users. To create tokens for service principals, see Manage tokens for a service principal.\n\nQuerying methods and examples\n\nMosaic AI Model Serving provides the following options for sending scoring requests to served models:\n\nMethod\n\n\t\n\nDetails\n\n\n\n\nServing UI\n\n\t\n\nSelect Query endpoint from the Serving endpoint page in your Databricks workspace. Insert JSON format model input data and click Send Request. If the model has an input example logged, use Show Example to load it.\n\n\n\n\nSQL function\n\n\t\n\nInvoke model inference directly from SQL using the ai_query SQL function. See Query a served model with ai_query.\n\n\n\n\nREST API\n\n\t\n\nCall and query the model using the REST API. See POST /serving-endpoints/{name}/invocations for details. For scoring requests to endpoints serving multiple models, see Query individual models behind an endpoint.\n\n\n\n\nMLflow Deployments SDK\n\n\t\n\nUse MLflow Deployments SDK’s predict() function to query the model.\n\nPandas DataFrame scoring example\n\nThe following example assumes a MODEL_VERSION_URI like https://<databricks-instance>/model/iris-classifier/Production/invocations, where <databricks-instance> is the name of your Databricks instance, and a Databricks REST API token called DATABRICKS_API_TOKEN.\n\nSee Supported scoring formats.\n\nREST API\nMLflow Deployments SDK\nSQL\nPowerBI\n\nScore a model accepting dataframe split input format.\n\nCopy\ncurl -X POST -u token:$DATABRICKS_API_TOKEN $MODEL_VERSION_URI \\\n  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n  -d '{\"dataframe_split\": [{\n    \"columns\": [\"sepal length (cm)\", \"sepal width (cm)\", \"petal length (cm)\", \"petal width (cm)\"],\n    \"data\": [[5.1, 3.5, 1.4, 0.2], [4.9, 3.0, 1.4, 0.2]]\n    }]\n  }'\n\n\nScore a model accepting tensor inputs. Tensor inputs should be formatted as described in TensorFlow Serving’s API documentation.\n\nCopy\ncurl -X POST -u token:$DATABRICKS_API_TOKEN $MODEL_VERSION_URI \\\n  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n  -d '{\"inputs\": [[5.1, 3.5, 1.4, 0.2]]}'\n\nTensor input example\n\nThe following example scores a model accepting tensor inputs. Tensor inputs should be formatted as described in TensorFlow Serving’s API docs. This example assumes a MODEL_VERSION_URI like https://<databricks-instance>/model/iris-classifier/Production/invocations, where <databricks-instance> is the name of your Databricks instance, and a Databricks REST API token called DATABRICKS_API_TOKEN.\n\nCopy\nBash\ncurl -X POST -u token:$DATABRICKS_API_TOKEN $MODEL_VERSION_URI \\\n    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n    -d '{\"inputs\": [[5.1, 3.5, 1.4, 0.2]]}'\n\nSupported scoring formats\n\nFor custom models, Model Serving supports scoring requests in Pandas DataFrame or Tensor input.\n\nPandas DataFrame\n\nRequests should be sent by constructing a JSON-serialized Pandas DataFrame with one of the supported keys and a JSON object corresponding to the input format.\n\n(Recommended)dataframe_split format is a JSON-serialized Pandas DataFrame in the split orientation.\n\nCopy\nJSON\n{\n  \"dataframe_split\": {\n    \"index\": [0, 1],\n    \"columns\": [\"sepal length (cm)\", \"sepal width (cm)\", \"petal length (cm)\", \"petal width (cm)\"],\n    \"data\": [[5.1, 3.5, 1.4, 0.2], [4.9, 3.0, 1.4, 0.2]]\n  }\n}\n\n\ndataframe_records is JSON-serialized Pandas DataFrame in the records orientation.\n\nNote\n\nThis format does not guarantee the preservation of column ordering, and the split format is preferred over the records format.\n\nCopy\nJSON\n{\n  \"dataframe_records\": [\n  {\n    \"sepal length (cm)\": 5.1,\n    \"sepal width (cm)\": 3.5,\n    \"petal length (cm)\": 1.4,\n    \"petal width (cm)\": 0.2\n  },\n  {\n    \"sepal length (cm)\": 4.9,\n    \"sepal width (cm)\": 3,\n    \"petal length (cm)\": 1.4,\n    \"petal width (cm)\": 0.2\n  },\n  {\n    \"sepal length (cm)\": 4.7,\n    \"sepal width (cm)\": 3.2,\n    \"petal length (cm)\": 1.3,\n    \"petal width (cm)\": 0.2\n  }\n  ]\n}\n\n\nThe response from the endpoint contains the output from your model, serialized with JSON, wrapped in a predictions key.\n\nCopy\nJSON\n{\n  \"predictions\": [0,1,1,1,0]\n}\n\nTensor input\n\nWhen your model expects tensors, like a TensorFlow or Pytorch model, there are two supported format options for sending requests: instances and inputs.\n\nIf you have multiple named tensors per row, then you have to have one of each tensor for every row.\n\ninstances is a tensors-based format that accepts tensors in row format. Use this format if all the input tensors have the same 0-th dimension. Conceptually, each tensor in the instances list could be joined with the other tensors of the same name in the rest of the list to construct the full input tensor for the model, which would only be possible if all of the tensors have the same 0-th dimension.\n\nCopy\nJSON\n{\"instances\": [ 1, 2, 3 ]}\n\n\nThe following example shows how to specify multiple named tensors.\n\nCopy\nJSON\n{\n \"instances\": [\n  {\n   \"t1\": \"a\",\n   \"t2\": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],\n   \"t3\": [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]\n  },\n  {\n   \"t1\": \"b\",\n   \"t2\": [6, 7, 8, 9, 10],\n   \"t3\": [[7, 8], [9, 10], [11, 12]]\n  }\n ]\n}\n\n\ninputs send queries with tensors in columnar format. This request is different because there are actually a different number of tensor instances of t2 (3) than t1 and t3, so it is not possible to represent this input in the instances format.\n\nCopy\nJSON\n{\n \"inputs\": {\n  \"t1\": [\"a\", \"b\"],\n  \"t2\": [[1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]],\n  \"t3\": [[[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]], [[7, 8], [9, 10], [11, 12]]]\n }\n}\n\n\nThe response from the endpoint is in the following format.\n\nCopy\nJSON\n{\n  \"predictions\": [0,1,1,1,0]\n}\n\nNotebook example\n\nSee the following notebook for an example of how to test your Model Serving endpoint with a Python model:\n\nTest Model Serving endpoint notebook\n\nOpen notebook in new tab\n Copy link for import\n\nLoading notebook...\nAdditional resources\n\nInference tables for monitoring and debugging models.\n\nQuery foundation models.\n\nDebugging guide for Model Serving.\n\n© Databricks 2025.

Common issues could include errors users encounter when the endpoint fails to initialize or start, build failures related to the container, or problems during the operation or running of the model on the endpoint.\n\nAccess and review logs\n\nDatabricks recommends reviewing build logs for debugging and troubleshooting errors in your model serving workloads. See Monitor model quality and endpoint health for information about logs and how to view them.\n\nCheck the event logs for the model in the workspace UI and check for a successful container build message. If you do not see a build message after an hour, reach out to Databricks support for assistance.\n\nIf your build is successful, but you encounter other errors see Debugging after container build succeeds. If your build fails, see Debugging after container build failure.\n\nInstalled library package versions\n\nIn your build logs you can confirm the package versions that are installed.\n\nFor MLflow versions, if you do not have a version specified, Model Serving uses the latest version.\n\nFor custom GPU serving, Model Serving installs the recommended versions of cuda and cuDNN according to public PyTorch and Tensorflow documentation.\n\nBefore model deployment validation checks\n\nDatabricks recommends applying the guidance in this section before you serve your model. The following parameters can catch issues early before waiting for the endpoint. See Validate the model input before deployment to validate your model input before deploying your model.\n\nTest predictions before deployment\n\nBefore deploying your model to the serving endpoint, test offline predictions with a virtual environment using mlflow.models.predict and input examples. See MLflow documentation for testing predictions for more detailed guidance.\n\nCopy\nPython\n\ninput_example = {\n                  \"messages\":\n                  [\n                    {\"content\": \"How many categories of products do we have? Name them.\", \"role\": \"user\"}\n                  ]\n                }\n\nmlflow.models.predict(\n   model_uri = logged_chain_info.model_uri,\n   input_data = input_example,\n)\n\nValidate the model input before deployment\n\nModel serving endpoints expect a special format of json input to validate that your model input works on a serving endpoint before deployment. You can use validate_serving_input in MLflow to do such validation.\n\nThe following is an example of the auto-generated code in the run’s artifacts tab if your model is logged with a valid input example.\n\nCopy\nPython\nfrom mlflow.models import validate_serving_input\n\nmodel_uri = 'runs:/<run_id>/<artifact_path>'\n\nserving_payload = \"\"\"{\n \"messages\": [\n   {\n     \"content\": \"How many product categories are there?\",\n     \"role\": \"user\"\n   }\n ]\n}\n\"\"\"\n\n# Validate the serving payload works on the model\nvalidate_serving_input(model_uri, serving_payload)\n\n\nYou can also test any input examples against the logged model by using convert_input_example_to_serving_input API to generate a valid json serving input.\n\nCopy\nPython\nfrom mlflow.models import validate_serving_input\nfrom mlflow.models import convert_input_example_to_serving_input\n\nmodel_uri = 'runs:/<run_id>/<artifact_path>'\n\n# Define INPUT_EXAMPLE with your own input example to the model\n# A valid input example is a data instance suitable for pyfunc prediction\n\nserving_payload = convert_input_example_to_serving_input(INPUT_EXAMPLE)\n\n# Validate the serving payload works on the model\nvalidate_serving_input(model_uri, serving_payload)\n\nDebugging after container build succeeds\n\nEven if the container builds successfully, there might be issues when you run the model or during the operation of the endpoint itself. The following subsections detail common issues and how to troubleshoot and debug\n\nMissing dependency\n\nYou might get an error like An error occurred while loading the model. No module named <module-name>.. This error might indicate that a dependency is missing from the container. Verify that you properly denoted all the dependencies that should be included in the build of the container. Pay special attention to custom libraries and ensure that the .whl files are included as artifacts.\n\nService logs looping\n\nIf your container build fails, check the service logs to see if you notice them looping when the endpoint tries to load the model. If you see this behavior try the following steps:\n\nOpen a notebook and attach to an All-Purpose cluster that uses a Databricks Runtime version, not Databricks Runtime for Machine Learning.\n\nLoad the model using MLflow and try debugging from there.\n\nYou can also load the model locally on your PC and debug from there. Load your model locally using the following:\n\nCopy\nPython\nimport os\nimport mlflow\n\nos.environ[\"MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI\"] = \"databricks://PROFILE\"\n\nARTIFACT_URI = \"model_uri\"\nif '.' in ARTIFACT_URI:\n    mlflow.set_registry_uri('databricks-uc')\nlocal_path = mlflow.artifacts.download_artifacts(ARTIFACT_URI)\nprint(local_path)\n\nconda env create -f local_path/artifact_path/conda.yaml\nconda activate mlflow-env\n\nmlflow.pyfunc.load_model(local_path/artifact_path)\n\nModel fails when requests are sent to the endpoint\n\nYou might receive an error like Encountered an unexpected error while evaluating the model. Verify that the input is compatible with the model for inference. when predict() is called on your model.\n\nThere is a code issue in the predict() function. Databricks recommends that you load the model from MLflow in a notebook and call it. Doing so highlights the issues in the predict() function, and you can see where the failure is happening within the method.\n\nWorkspace exceeds provisioned concurrency\n\nYou might receive a Workspace exceeded provisioned concurrency quota error.\n\nYou can increase concurrency depending on region availability. Reach out to your Databricks account team and provide your workspace ID to request a concurrency increase.\n\nDebugging after container build failure\n\nThis section details issues that might occur when your build fails.\n\nOSError: [Errno 28] No space left on device\n\nThe No space left error can be due to too many large artifacts being logged alongside the model unnecessarily. Check in MLflow that extraneous artifacts are not logged alongside the model and try to redeploy the slimmed down package.\n\nBuild failure due to lack of GPU availability\n\nYou might see an the error: Build could not start due to an internal error - please contact your Databricks representative..\n\nReach out to your Databricks account team to help resolve.\n\nWas this article helpful?\n\n© Databricks 2025.

These are foundation models that are hosted outside of Databricks. Endpoints that serve external models can be centrally governed and customers can establish rate limits and access control for them. Examples include foundation models like, OpenAI’s GPT-4, Anthropic’s Claude, and others.\n\nState-of-the-art open foundation models made available by Foundation Model APIs. These models are curated foundation model architectures that support optimized inference. Base models, like Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct, GTE-Large, and Mistral-7B are available for immediate use with pay-per-token pricing. Production workloads, using base or fine-tuned models, can be deployed with performance guarantees using provisioned throughput.\n\nModel Serving provides the following options for model serving endpoint creation:\n\nThe Serving UI\n\nREST API\n\nMLflow Deployments SDK\n\nFor creating endpoints that serve traditional ML or Python models, see Create custom model serving endpoints.\n\nRequirements\n\nA Databricks workspace in a supported region.\n\nFoundation Model APIs regions\n\nExternal models regions\n\nFor creating endpoints using the MLflow Deployments SDK, you must install the MLflow Deployment client. To install it, run:\n\nCopy\nPython\nimport mlflow.deployments\n\nclient = mlflow.deployments.get_deploy_client(\"databricks\")\n\nCreate a foundation model serving endpoint\n\nYou can create an endpoint that serves fine-tuned variants of foundation models made available using Foundation Model APIs provisioned throughput. See Create your provisioned throughput endpoint using the REST API.\n\nFor foundation models that are made available using Foundation Model APIs pay-per-token, Databricks automatically provides specific endpoints to access the supported models in your Databricks workspace. To access them, select the Serving tab in the left sidebar of the workspace. The Foundation Model APIs are located at the top of the Endpoints list view.\n\nFor querying these endpoints, see Query foundation models.\n\nCreate an external model serving endpoint\n\nThe following describes how to create an endpoint that queries a foundation model made available using Databricks external models.\n\nServing UI\nREST API\nMLflow Deployments SDK\n\nIn the Name field provide a name for your endpoint.\n\nIn the Served entities section\n\nClick into the Entity field to open the Select served entity form.\n\nSelect External model.\n\nSelect the model provider you want to use.\n\nClick Confirm\n\nProvide the name of the external model you want to use. The form dynamically updates based on your selection. See the available external models.\n\nSelect the task type. Available tasks are chat, completions, and embeddings.\n\nProvide the configuration details for accessing the selected model provider. This is typically the secret that references the personal access token you want the endpoint to use for accessing this model.\n\nClick Create. The Serving endpoints page appears with Serving endpoint state shown as Not Ready.\n\nUpdate model serving endpoints\n\nAfter enabling a model endpoint, you can set the compute configuration as desired. This configuration is particularly helpful if you need additional resources for your model. Workload size and compute configuration play a key role in what resources are allocated for serving your model.\n\nUntil the new configuration is ready, the old configuration keeps serving prediction traffic. While there is an update in progress, another update cannot be made. In the Serving UI, you can cancel an in progress configuration update by selecting Cancel update on the top right of the endpoint’s details page. This functionality is only available in the Serving UI.\n\nWhen an external_model is present in an endpoint configuration, the served entities list can only have one served_entity object. Existing endpoints with an external_model can not be updated to no longer have an external_model. If the endpoint is created without an external_model, you cannot update it to add an external_model.\n\nREST API\nMLflow Deployments SDK\n\nTo update your endpoint see the REST API update configuration documentation for request and response schema details.\n\nCopy\n{\n  \"name\": \"openai_endpoint\",\n  \"served_entities\":\n  [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"openai_chat\",\n      \"external_model\":{\n        \"name\": \"gpt-4\",\n        \"provider\": \"openai\",\n        \"task\": \"llm/v1/chat\",\n        \"openai_config\":{\n          \"openai_api_key\": \"{{secrets/my_scope/my_openai_api_key}}\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nAdditional resources\n\nAI Gateway-enabled inference tables\n\nQuery foundation models.\n\nExternal models in Mosaic AI Model Serving.\n\n© Databricks 2025.

You can also serve different versions of a model at the same time, which makes experimenting with new versions easier, while keeping the current version in production.\n\nYou can serve any of the following model types on a Mosaic AI Model Serving endpoint. You can not serve different model types in a single endpoint. For example you can not serve a custom model and an external model in the same endpoint.\n\nCustom models\n\nGenerative AI models made available through Foundation Model APIs provisioned throughput\n\nExternal models\n\nRequirements\n\nSee the Requirements for model serving endpoint creation.\n\nTo understand access control options for model serving endpoints and best practice guidance for endpoint management, see Serving endpoint ACLs.\n\nCreate an endpoint and set the initial traffic split\n\nWhen you create model serving endpoints using the Databricks Mosaic AI serving API or the Databricks Mosaic AI serving UI, you can also set the initial traffic split for the models you want to serve on that endpoint. The following sections provide examples of setting the traffic split for multiple custom models or foundation models served on an endpoint.\n\nServe multiple custom models to an endpoint\n\nThe following REST API example creates a single endpoint with two custom models in Unity Catalog and sets the endpoint traffic split between those models. The served entity, current, hosts version 1 of model-A and gets 90% of the endpoint traffic, while the other served entity, challenger, hosts version 1 of model-B and gets 10% of the endpoint traffic.\n\nCopy\nBash\nPOST /api/2.0/serving-endpoints\n\n{\n   \"name\":\"multi-model\"\n   \"config\":\n   {\n      \"served_entities\":\n      [\n         {\n            \"name\":\"current\",\n            \"entity_name\":\"catalog.schema.model-A\",\n            \"entity_version\":\"1\",\n            \"workload_size\":\"Small\",\n            \"scale_to_zero_enabled\":true\n         },\n         {\n            \"name\":\"challenger\",\n            \"entity_name\":\"catalog.schema.model-B\",\n            \"entity_version\":\"1\",\n            \"workload_size\":\"Small\",\n            \"scale_to_zero_enabled\":true\n         }\n      ],\n      \"traffic_config\":\n      {\n         \"routes\":\n         [\n            {\n               \"served_model_name\":\"current\",\n               \"traffic_percentage\":\"90\"\n            },\n            {\n               \"served_model_name\":\"challenger\",\n               \"traffic_percentage\":\"10\"\n            }\n         ]\n      }\n   }\n}\n\nServe multiple models to a provisioned throughput endpoint\n\nThe following REST API example creates a single Foundation Model APIs provisioned throughput endpoint with two models and sets the endpoint traffic split between those models. The endpoint named multi-pt-model, hosts version 2 of mistral_7b_instruct_v0_1-2 which gets 60% of the endpoint traffic, and also hosts version 3 of mixtral_8x7b_instruct_v0_1-3 which gets 40% of the endpoint traffic.\n\nCopy\nBash\nPOST /api/2.0/serving-endpoints\n{\n   \"name\":\"multi-pt-model\"\n   \"config\":\n   {\n      \"served_entities\":\n      [\n         {\n            \"name\":\"mistral_7b_instruct_v0_1-2\",\n            \"entity_name\":\"system.ai.mistral_7b_instruct_v0_1\",\n            \"entity_version\":\"2\",\n            \"min_provisioned_throughput\":0,\n            \"max_provisioned_throughput\":1940\n         },\n         {\n            \"name\":\"mixtral_8x7b_instruct_v0_1-3\",\n            \"entity_name\":\"system.ai.mixtral_8x7b_instruct_v0_1\",\n            \"entity_version\":\"3\",\n            \"min_provisioned_throughput\":0,\n            \"max_provisioned_throughput\":1240\n         }\n      ],\n      \"traffic_config\":\n      {\n         \"routes\":\n         [\n            {\n               \"served_model_name\":\"mistral_7b_instruct_v0_1-2\",\n               \"traffic_percentage\":\"60\"\n            },\n            {\n               \"served_model_name\":\"mixtral_8x7b_instruct_v0_1-3\",\n               \"traffic_percentage\":\"40\"\n            }\n         ]\n      }\n   }\n}\n\nServe multiple external models to an endpoint\n\nYou can also configure multiple external models in a serving endpoint as long as they all have the same task type and each model has a unique name. You cannot have both external models and non-external models in the same serving endpoint.\n\nThe following example creates a serving endpoint that routes 50% of the traffic to gpt-4 provided by OpenAI and the remaining 50% to claude-3-opus-20240229 provided by Anthropic.\n\nCopy\nPython\nimport mlflow.deployments\n\nclient = mlflow.deployments.get_deploy_client(\"databricks\")\n\nclient.create_endpoint(\n    name=\"mix-chat-endpoint\",\n    config={\n        \"served_entities\": [\n            {\n                \"name\": \"served_model_name_1\",\n                \"external_model\": {\n                    \"name\": \"gpt-4\",\n                    \"provider\": \"openai\",\n                    \"task\": \"llm/v1/chat\",\n                    \"openai_config\": {\n                        \"openai_api_key\": \"{{secrets/my_openai_secret_scope/openai_api_key}}\"\n                    }\n                }\n            },\n            {\n                \"name\": \"served_model_name_2\",\n                \"external_model\": {\n                    \"name\": \"claude-3-opus-20240229\",\n                    \"provider\": \"anthropic\",\n                    \"task\": \"llm/v1/chat\",\n                    \"anthropic_config\": {\n                        \"anthropic_api_key\": \"{{secrets/my_anthropic_secret_scope/anthropic_api_key}}\"\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n        ],\n        \"traffic_config\": {\n            \"routes\": [\n                {\"served_model_name\": \"served_model_name_1\", \"traffic_percentage\": 50},\n                {\"served_model_name\": \"served_model_name_2\", \"traffic_percentage\": 50}\n            ]\n        },\n    }\n)\n\nUpdate the traffic split between served models\n\nYou can also update the traffic split between served models. The following REST API example sets the served model, current, to get 50% of the endpoint traffic and the other model, challenger, to get the remaining 50% of the traffic.\n\nYou can also make this update from the Serving tab in the Databricks Mosaic AI UI using the Edit configuration button.\n\nCopy\nBash\nPUT /api/2.0/serving-endpoints/{name}/config\n\n{\n   \"served_entities\":\n   [\n      {\n         \"name\":\"current\",\n         \"entity_name\":\"catalog.schema.model-A\",\n         \"entity_version\":\"1\",\n         \"workload_size\":\"Small\",\n         \"scale_to_zero_enabled\":true\n      },\n      {\n         \"name\":\"challenger\",\n         \"entity_name\":\"catalog.schema.model-B\",\n         \"entity_version\":\"1\",\n         \"workload_size\":\"Small\",\n         \"scale_to_zero_enabled\":true\n      }\n   ],\n   \"traffic_config\":\n   {\n      \"routes\":\n      [\n         {\n            \"served_model_name\":\"current\",\n            \"traffic_percentage\":\"50\"\n         },\n         {\n            \"served_model_name\":\"challenger\",\n            \"traffic_percentage\":\"50\"\n         }\n      ]\n   }\n}\n\nQuery individual models behind an endpoint\n\nIn some scenarios, you might want to query individual models behind the endpoint.\n\nYou can do so by using:\n\nCopy\nBash\nPOST /serving-endpoints/{endpoint-name}/served-models/{served-model-name}/invocations\n\n\nHere the specific served model is queried. The request format is the same as querying the endpoint. While querying the individual served model, the traffic settings are ignored.\n\nIn the context of the multi-model endpoint example, if all requests are sent to /serving-endpoints/multi-model/served-models/challenger/invocations, then all requests are served by the challenger served model.\n\n© Databricks 2025.

For custom models, see Inference tables for monitoring and debugging models.\n\nThis article describes AI Gateway-enabled inference tables for monitoring served models. The inference table automatically captures incoming requests and outgoing responses for an endpoint and logs them as a Unity Catalog Delta table. You can use the data in this table to monitor, evaluate, compare, and fine-tune machine learning models.\n\nWhat are AI Gateway-enabled inference tables?\n\nAI Gateway-enabled inference tables simplify monitoring and diagnostics for models by continuously logging serving request inputs and responses (predictions) from Mosaic AI Model Serving endpoints and saving them into a Delta table in Unity Catalog. You can then use all of the capabilities of the Databricks platform, such as Databricks SQL queries and notebooks to monitor, debug, and optimize your models.\n\nYou can enable inference tables on existing or newly created model serving endpoint, and requests to that endpoint are then automatically logged to a table in Unity Catalog.\n\nSome common applications for inference tables are the following:\n\nCreate a training corpus. By joining inference tables with ground truth labels, you can create a training corpus that you can use to retrain or fine-tune and improve your model. Using Databricks Jobs, you can set up a continuous feedback loop and automate re-training.\n\nMonitor data and model quality. You can continuously monitor your model performance and data drift using Lakehouse Monitoring. Lakehouse Monitoring automatically generates data and model quality dashboards that you can share with stakeholders. Additionally, you can enable alerts to know when you need to retrain your model based on shifts in incoming data or reductions in model performance.\n\nDebug production issues. Inference tables log data like HTTP status codes, request and response JSON code, model run times, and traces output during model run times. You can use this performance data for debugging purposes. You can also use the historical data in inference tables to compare model performance on historical requests.\n\nRequirements\n\nAI Gateway-enabled inference tables are only supported for endpoints that use provisioned throughput or serve external models.\n\nA Databricks workspace in either:\n\nExternal models supported region\n\nProvisioned throughput supported region\n\nFor private connectivity, complete the steps in Enable private connectivity using AWS PrivateLink. AWS PrivateLink is not supported by default.\n\nDatabricks recommends that you Enable predictive optimization for optimized performance of your inference tables.\n\nYour workspace must have Unity Catalog enabled.\n\nBoth the creator of the endpoint and the modifier must have Can Manage permission on the endpoint. See Access control lists.\n\nBoth the creator of the endpoint and the modifier must have the following permissions in Unity Catalog:\n\nUSE CATALOG permissions on the specified catalog.\n\nUSE SCHEMA permissions on the specified schema.\n\nCREATE TABLE permissions in the schema.\n\nWarning\n\nThe inference table could stop logging data or become corrupted if you do any of the following:\n\nChange the table schema.\n\nChange the table name.\n\nDelete the table.\n\nLose permissions to the Unity Catalog catalog or schema.\n\nEnable and disable inference tables\n\nThis section shows you how to enable or disable inference tables using the Serving UI. The owner of the inference tables is the user who created the endpoint. All access control lists (ACLs) on the table follow the standard Unity Catalog permissions and can be modified by the table owner.\n\nTo enable inference tables during endpoint creation use the following steps:\n\nClick Serving in the Databricks Mosaic AI UI.\n\nClick Create serving endpoint.\n\nIn the AI Gateway section, select Enable inference tables.\n\nYou can also enable inference tables on an existing endpoint. To edit an existing endpoint configuration do the following:\n\nIn the AI Gateway section, click Edit AI Gateway.\n\nSelect Enable inference tables.\n\nFollow these instructions to disable inference tables:\n\nNavigate to your endpoint page.\n\nClick Edit AI Gateway.\n\nClick Enable inference table to remove the checkmark.\n\nAfter you are satisfied with the AI Gateway specifications, click Update.\n\nQuery and analyze results in the inference table\n\nAfter your served models are ready, all requests made to your models are logged automatically to the inference table, along with the responses. You can view the table in the UI, query the table from Databricks SQL or a notebook, or query the table using the REST API.\n\nTo view the table in the UI: On the endpoint page, click the name of the inference table to open the table in Catalog Explorer.\n\nTo query the table from Databricks SQL or a Databricks notebook: You can run code similar to the following to query the inference table.\n\nCopy\nSQL\nSELECT * FROM <catalog>.<schema>.<payload_table>\n\n\nTo join your inference table data with details about the underlying foundation model served on your endpoint: Foundation model details are captured in the system.serving.served_entities system table.\n\nCopy\nSQL\nSELECT * FROM <catalog>.<schema>.<payload_table> payload\nJOIN system.serving.served_entities se on payload.served_entity_id = se.served_entity_id\n\n\nAI Gateway-enabled inference table schema\n\nInference tables enabled using AI Gateway have the following schema:\n\nColumn name\n\n\t\n\nDescription\n\n\t\n\nType\n\n\n\n\nrequest_date\n\n\t\n\nThe UTC date on which the model serving request was received.\n\n\t\n\nDATE\n\n\n\n\ndatabricks_request_id\n\n\t\n\nA Databricks generated request identifier attached to all model serving requests.\n\n\t\n\nSTRING\n\n\n\n\nrequest_time\n\n\t\n\nThe timestamp at which the request is received.\n\n\t\n\nTIMESTAMP\n\n\n\n\nstatus_code\n\n\t\n\nThe HTTP status code that was returned from the model.\n\n\t\n\nINT\n\n\n\n\nsampling_fraction\n\n\t\n\nThe sampling fraction used in the event that the request was down-sampled.

Reach out to your Databricks account team for more information.\n\nThe maximum request and response size that are logged is 1 MiB (1,048,576 bytes). Request and response payloads that exceed this are logged as null and logging_error_codes are populated with MAX_REQUEST_SIZE_EXCEEDED or MAX_RESPONSE_SIZE_EXCEEDED.\n\nFor limitations specific to AI Gateway, see Limitations.

Databricks Function Calling is OpenAI-compatible and is only available during model serving as part of Foundation Model APIs.\n\nWhat is function calling\n\nFunction calling provides a way for you to control the output of LLMs, so they generate structured responses more reliably. When you use a function call, you describe functions in the API call by describing the function arguments using a JSON schema. The LLM itself does not call these functions, but instead it creates a JSON object that users can use to call the functions in their code.\n\nFor function calling on Databricks, the basic sequence of steps are as follows:\n\nCall the model using the submitted query and a set of functions defined in the tools parameter.\n\nThe model decides whether or not to call the defined functions. When the function is called, the content is a JSON object of strings that adheres to your custom schema.\n\nParse the strings into JSON in your code, and call your function with the provided arguments if they exist.\n\nCall the model again by appending the structured response as a new message. The structure of the response is defined by the functions you previously provided in tools. From here, the model summarizes the results and sends that summary to the user.\n\nWhen to use function calling\n\nThe following are example use cases for function calling:\n\nCreate assistants that can answer questions by calling other APIs. For example, you can define functions like send_email(to: string, body: string) or current_weather(location: string, unit: 'celsius' | 'fahrenheit').\n\nDefine and use API calls based on natural language. Like taking the statement, “Who are my top customers?” and making that into an API call named, get_customers(min_revenue: int, created_before: string, limit: int) and calling that API.\n\nFor batch inference or data processing tasks, like converting unstructured data into structured data. Databricks recommends using structured outputs.\n\nSupported models\n\nThe following table lists the supported models and which model serving feature makes each model available.\n\nFor models made available by Foundation Model APIs, see Foundation Model APIs limits for region availability.\n\nFor models made available by External models, see Region availability for region availability.\n\nImportant\n\nStarting December 11, 2024, Meta-Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct replaces support for Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct in Foundation Model APIs pay-per-token endpoints.\n\nImportant\n\nMeta Llama 3.3 is licensed under the LLAMA 3.3 Community License, Copyright © Meta Platforms, Inc.

This lets the model decide which functions to call and whether to call them.\n\nYou can customize the default behavior depending on your use case. The following are your options:\n\nSet tool_choice: \"required\". In this scenario, the model always calls one or more functions. The model selects which function or functions to call.\n\nSet tool_choice: {\"type\": \"function\", \"function\": {\"name\": \"my_function\"}}. In this scenario, the model calls only a specific function.\n\nSet tool_choice: \"none\" to disable function calling and have the model only generate a user-facing message.\n\nThe following is a single turn example using the OpenAI SDK and its tools parameter. See Chat task for additional syntax details.\n\nImportant\n\nDuring Public Preview, function calling on Databricks is optimized for single turn function calling.\n\nCopy\nPython\nimport os\nimport json\nfrom openai import OpenAI\n\nDATABRICKS_TOKEN = os.environ.get('YOUR_DATABRICKS_TOKEN')\nDATABRICKS_BASE_URL = os.environ.get('YOUR_DATABRICKS_BASE_URL')\n\nclient = OpenAI(\n  api_key=DATABRICKS_TOKEN,\n  base_url=DATABRICKS_BASE_URL\n  )\n\ntools = [\n  {\n    \"type\": \"function\",\n    \"function\": {\n      \"name\": \"get_current_weather\",\n      \"description\": \"Get the current weather in a given location\",\n      \"parameters\": {\n        \"type\": \"object\",\n        \"properties\": {\n          \"location\": {\n            \"type\": \"string\",\n            \"description\": \"The city and state, e.g. San Francisco, CA\"\n          },\n          \"unit\": {\n            \"type\": \"string\",\n            \"enum\": [\n              \"celsius\",\n              \"fahrenheit\"\n            ]\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n]\n\nmessages = [{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"What is the current temperature of Chicago?\"}]\n\nresponse = client.chat.completions.create(\n    model=\"databricks-meta-llama-3-3-70b-instruct\",\n    messages=messages,\n    tools=tools,\n    tool_choice=\"auto\",\n)\n\nprint(json.dumps(response.choices[0].message.model_dump()['tool_calls'], indent=2))\n\nJSON schema\n\nFoundation Model APIs broadly support function definitions accepted by OpenAI. However, using a simpler JSON schema for function call definitions results in higher quality function call JSON generation. To promote higher quality generation, Foundation Model APIs only support a subset of JSON schema specifications.\n\nThe following function call definition keys are not supported:\n\nRegular expressions using pattern.\n\nComplex nested or schema composition and validation using: anyOf, oneOf, allOf, prefixItems, or $ref.\n\nLists of types except for the special case of [type, “null”] where one type in the list is a valid JSON type and the other is \"null\"\n\nAdditionally, the following limitations apply:\n\nThe maximum number of keys specified in the JSON schema is 16.\n\nFoundation Model APIs does not enforce length or size constraints for objects and arrays.\n\nThis includes keywords like maxProperties, minProperties, and maxLength.\n\nHeavily nested JSON schemas will result in lower quality generation. If possible, try flattening the JSON schema for better results.\n\nToken usage\n\nPrompt injection and other techniques are used to enhance the quality of tool calls. Doing so impacts the number of input and output tokens consumed by the model, which in turn results in billing implications. The more tools you use, the more your input tokens increase.\n\nLimitations\n\nThe following are limitations for function calling during Public Preview:\n\nThe current function calling solution is optimized for single turn function calls. Multi-turn function calling is supported during the preview, but is under development.\n\nParallel function calling is not supported.\n\nThe maximum number of functions that can be defined in tools is 32 functions.\n\nFor provisioned throughput support, function calling is only supported on new endpoints. You cannot add function calling to previously created endpoints.\n\nNotebook example\n\nSee the following notebook for detailed function calling examples\n\nFunction calling example notebook\n\nOpen notebook in new tab\n Copy link for import\n\nLoading notebook...\n\n© Databricks 2025.

See Scoring a model endpoint for details on the new format protocol.\n\nIn Model Serving, the endpoint URL includes serving-endpoints instead of model.\n\nModel Serving includes full support for managing resources with API workflows.\n\nModel Serving is production-ready and backed by the Databricks SLA.\n\nMigrate Legacy MLflow Model Serving served models to Model Serving\n\nYou can create a Model Serving endpoint and flexibly transition model serving workflows without disabling Legacy MLflow Model Serving.\n\nThe following steps show how to accomplish this with the UI. For each model on which you have Legacy MLflow Model Serving enabled:\n\nRegister your model to Unity Catalog.\n\nNavigate to Serving endpoints on the sidebar of your machine learning workspace.\n\nFollow the workflow described in Create custom model serving endpoints on how to create a serving endpoint with your model.\n\nTransition your application to use the new URL provided by the serving endpoint to query the model, along with the new scoring format.\n\nWhen your models are transitioned over, you can navigate to Models on the sidebar of your machine learning workspace.\n\nSelect the model for which you want to disable Legacy MLflow Model Serving.\n\nOn the Serving tab, select Stop.\n\nA message appears to confirm. Select Stop Serving.\n\nMigrate deployed model versions to Model Serving\n\nIn previous versions of the Model Serving functionality, the serving endpoint was created based on the stage of the registered model version: Staging or Production. To migrate your served models from that experience, you can replicate that behavior in the new Model Serving experience.\n\nThis section demonstrates how to create separate model serving endpoints for Staging model versions and Production model versions. The following steps show how to accomplish this with the serving endpoints API for each of your served models.\n\nIn the example, the registered model name modelA has version 1 in the model stage Production and version 2 in the model stage Staging.\n\nCreate two endpoints for your registered model, one for Staging model versions and another for Production model versions.\n\nFor Staging model versions:\n\nCopy\nBash\nPOST /api/2.0/serving-endpoints\n  {\n     \"name\":\"modelA-Staging\"\n     \"config\":\n     {\n        \"served_entities\":\n        [\n           {\n              \"entity_name\":\"model-A\",\n              \"entity_version\":\"2\",  // Staging Model Version\n              \"workload_size\":\"Small\",\n              \"scale_to_zero_enabled\":true\n           },\n        ],\n     },\n  }\n\n\nFor Production model versions:\n\nCopy\nBash\nPOST /api/2.0/serving-endpoints\n  {\n     \"name\":\"modelA-Production\"\n     \"config\":\n     {\n        \"served_entities\":\n        [\n           {\n              \"entity_name\":\"model-A\",\n              \"entity_version\":\"1\",   // Production Model Version\n              \"workload_size\":\"Small\",\n              \"scale_to_zero_enabled\":true\n           },\n        ],\n     },\n  }\n\n\nVerify the status of the endpoints.\n\nFor Staging endpoint: GET /api/2.0/serving-endpoints/modelA-Staging\n\nFor Production endpoint: GET /api/2.0/serving-endpoints/modelA-Production\n\nOnce the endpoints are ready, query the endpoint using:\n\nFor Staging endpoint: POST /serving-endpoints/modelA-Staging/invocations\n\nFor Production endpoint: POST /serving-endpoints/modelA-Production/invocations\n\nUpdate the endpoint based on model version transitions.\n\nIn the scenario where a new model version 3 is created, you can have the model version 2 transition to Production, while model version 3 can transition to Staging and model version 1 is Archived. These changes can be reflected in separate model serving endpoints as follows:\n\nFor the Staging endpoint, update the endpoint to use the new model version in Staging.\n\nCopy\nBash\nPUT /api/2.0/serving-endpoints/modelA-Staging/config\n{\n   \"served_entities\":\n   [\n      {\n         \"entity_name\":\"model-A\",\n         \"entity_version\":\"3\",  // New Staging model version\n         \"workload_size\":\"Small\",\n         \"scale_to_zero_enabled\":true\n      },\n   ],\n}\n\n\nFor Production endpoint, update the endpoint to use the new model version in Production.\n\nCopy\nBash\nPUT /api/2.0/serving-endpoints/modelA-Production/config\n{\n   \"served_entities\":\n   [\n      {\n         \"entity_name\":\"model-A\",\n         \"entity_version\":\"2\",  // New Production model version\n         \"workload_size\":\"Small\",\n         \"scale_to_zero_enabled\":true\n      },\n   ],\n}\n\nMigrate MosaicML inference workflows to Model Serving\n\nThis section provides guidance on how to migrate your MosaicML inference deployments to Mosaic AI Model Serving and includes a notebook example.\n\nThe following table summarizes the parity between MosaicML inference and model serving on Databricks.\n\nMosaicML Inference\n\n\t\n\nMosaic AI Model Serving\n\n\n\n\ncreate_inference_deployment\n\n\t\n\nCreate a model serving endpoint\n\n\n\n\nupdate_inference_deployment\n\n\t\n\nUpdate a model serving endpoint\n\n\n\n\ndelete_inference_deployment\n\n\t\n\nDelete a model serving endpoint\n\n\n\n\nget_inference_deployment\n\n\t\n\nGet status of a model serving endpoint\n\nThe following notebook provides a guided example of migrating a llama-13b model from MosaicML to Mosaic AI Model Serving.\n\nMigrate from MosaicML inference to Mosaic AI Model Serving notebook\n\nOpen notebook in new tab\n Copy link for import\n\nLoading notebook...\nAdditional resources\n\nCreate Model Serving endpoints\n\n© Databricks 2025.

Support for this functionality is evaluated and implemented on a per-region basis. Reach out to your Databricks account team for more information.\n\nModel Serving does not provide security patches to existing model images because of the risk of destabilization to production deployments. A new model image created from a new model version will contain the latest patches. Reach out to your Databricks account team for more information.\n\nFoundation Model APIs limits\n\nNote\n\nAs part of providing the Foundation Model APIs, Databricks might process your data outside of the region and cloud provider where your data originated.\n\nFor both pay-per-token and provisioned throughput workloads:\n\nOnly workspace admins can change the governance settings, such as rate limits for Foundation Model APIs endpoints. To change rate limits use the following steps:\n\nOpen the Serving UI in your workspace to see your serving endpoints.\n\nFrom the kebab menu on the Foundation Model APIs endpoint you want to edit, select View details.\n\nFrom the kebab menu on the upper-right side of the endpoints details page, select Change rate limit.\n\nThe GTE Large (En) embedding models do not generate normalized embeddings.\n\nPay-per-token limits\n\nThe following are limits relevant to Foundation Model APIs pay-per-token workloads:\n\nPay-per-token workloads are not HIPAA or compliance security profile compliant.\n\nMeta Llama 3.3 70B Instruct and GTE Large (En) models are available in pay-per-token EU and US supported regions.\n\nThe following pay-per-token models are supported only in the Foundation Model APIs pay-per-token supported US regions:\n\nMeta Llama 3.1 405B Instruct\n\nDBRX Instruct\n\nMixtral-8x7B Instruct\n\nBGE Large (En)\n\nIf your workspace is in a Model Serving region but not a U.S. or EU region, your workspace must be enabled for cross-Geo data processing. When enabled, your pay-per-token workload is routed to the U.S. Databricks Geo. To see which geographic regions process pay-per-token workloads, see Databricks Designated Services.\n\nProvisioned throughput limits\n\nThe following are limits relevant to Foundation Model APIs provisioned throughput workloads:\n\nProvisioned throughput supports the HIPAA compliance profile and is recommended for workloads that require compliance certifications.\n\nTo use the DBRX model architecture for a provisioned throughput workload, your serving endpoint must be in us-east-1 or us-west-2.\n\nThe following table shows the region availability of the supported Meta Llama 3.1 and 3.2 models. See Deploy fine-tuned foundation models for guidance on how to deploy fine-tuned models.\n\nMeta Llama model variant\n\n\t\n\nRegions\n\n\n\n\nmeta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B\n\n\t\n\nus-east-1\n\nus-east-2\n\nus-west-2\n\nap-northeast-1\n\nap-southeast-1\n\n\n\n\nmeta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct\n\n\t\n\nus-east-1\n\nus-east-2\n\nus-west-2\n\nap-northeast-1\n\nap-southeast-1\n\n\n\n\nmeta-llama/Llama-3.1-70B\n\n\t\n\nus-east-1\n\nus-east-2\n\nus-west-2\n\nap-northeast-1\n\nap-southeast-1\n\n\n\n\nmeta-llama/Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct\n\n\t\n\nus-east-1\n\nus-east-2\n\nus-west-2\n\nap-northeast-1\n\nap-southeast-1\n\n\n\n\nmeta-llama/Llama-3.1-405B\n\n\t\n\nus-east-1\n\nus-east-2\n\nus-west-2\n\nap-northeast-1\n\nap-southeast-1\n\n\n\n\nmeta-llama/Llama-3.1-405B-Instruct\n\n\t\n\nus-east-1\n\nus-east-2\n\nus-west-2\n\nap-northeast-1\n\nap-southeast-1\n\n\n\n\nmeta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B\n\n\t\n\nus-east-1\n\nus-east-2\n\nus-west-2\n\nap-northeast-1\n\nap-southeast-1\n\n\n\n\nmeta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct\n\n\t\n\nus-east-1\n\nus-east-2\n\nus-west-2\n\nap-northeast-1\n\nap-southeast-1\n\n\n\n\nmeta-llama/Llama-3.2-3B\n\n\t\n\nus-east-1\n\nus-east-2\n\nus-west-2\n\nap-northeast-1\n\nap-southeast-1\n\n\n\n\nmeta-llama/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct\n\n\t\n\nus-east-1\n\nus-east-2\n\nus-west-2\n\nap-northeast-1\n\nap-southeast-1\n\n\n\n\nmeta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B\n\n\t\n\nus-east-1\n\nus-east-2\n\nus-west-2\n\nap-northeast-1\n\nap-southeast-1\n\nRegion availability\n\nNote\n\nIf you require an endpoint in an unsupported region, reach out to your Databricks account team.\n\nIf your workspace is deployed in a region that supports model serving but is served by a control plane in an unsupported region, the workspace does not support model serving. If you attempt to use model serving in such a workspace, you will see in an error message stating that your workspace is not supported. Reach out to your Databricks account team for more information.\n\nFor more information on regional availability of features, see Model serving feature availability.\n\n© Databricks 2025.

Learn more about external models.\n\nIf you prefer to use the Serving UI to accomplish this task, see Create an external model serving endpoint.\n\nRequirements\n\nDatabricks Runtime 13.0 ML or above.\n\nMLflow 2.9 or above.\n\nOpenAI API keys.\n\nInstall the Databricks CLI version 0.205 or above.\n\n(Optional) Step 0: Store the OpenAI API key using the Databricks Secrets CLI\n\nYou can provide your API keys either as plaintext strings in Step 3 or by using Databricks Secrets.\n\nTo store the OpenAI API key as a secret, you can use the Databricks Secrets CLI (version 0.205 and above). You can also use the REST API for secrets.\n\nThe following creates the secret scope named, my_openai_secret_scope, and then creates the secret openai_api_key in that scope.\n\nCopy\nSh\ndatabricks secrets create-scope my_openai_secret_scope\ndatabricks secrets put-secret my_openai_secret_scope openai_api_key\n\nStep 1: Install MLflow with external models support\n\nUse the following to install an MLflow version with external models support:\n\nCopy\nSh\n%pip install mlflow[genai]>=2.9.0\n\nStep 2: Create and manage an external model endpoint\n\nImportant\n\nThe code examples in this section demonstrate usage of the Public Preview MLflow Deployments CRUD SDK.\n\nTo create an external model endpoint for a large language model (LLM), use the create_endpoint() method from the MLflow Deployments SDK. You can also create external model endpoints in the Serving UI.\n\nThe following code snippet creates a completions endpoint for OpenAI gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct, as specified in the served_entities section of the configuration. For your endpoint, be sure to populate the name and openai_api_key with your unique values for each field.\n\nCopy\nPython\nimport mlflow.deployments\n\nclient = mlflow.deployments.get_deploy_client(\"databricks\")\nclient.create_endpoint(\n    name=\"openai-completions-endpoint\",\n    config={\n        \"served_entities\": [{\n            \"name\": \"openai-completions\",\n            \"external_model\": {\n                \"name\": \"gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct\",\n                \"provider\": \"openai\",\n                \"task\": \"llm/v1/completions\",\n                \"openai_config\": {\n                    \"openai_api_key\": \"{{secrets/my_openai_secret_scope/openai_api_key}}\"\n                }\n            }\n        }]\n    }\n)\n\n\nThe following code snippet shows how you can provide your OpenAI API key as a plaintext string for an alternative way to create the same completions endpoint as above.\n\nCopy\nPython\nimport mlflow.deployments\n\nclient = mlflow.deployments.get_deploy_client(\"databricks\")\nclient.create_endpoint(\n    name=\"openai-completions-endpoint\",\n    config={\n        \"served_entities\": [{\n            \"name\": \"openai-completions\",\n            \"external_model\": {\n                \"name\": \"gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct\",\n                \"provider\": \"openai\",\n                \"task\": \"llm/v1/completions\",\n                \"openai_config\": {\n                    \"openai_api_key_plaintext\": \"sk-yourApiKey\"\n                }\n            }\n        }]\n    }\n)\n\n\nIf you are using Azure OpenAI, you can also specify the Azure OpenAI deployment name, endpoint URL, and API version in the openai_config section of the configuration.\n\nCopy\nPython\nclient.create_endpoint(\n    name=\"openai-completions-endpoint\",\n    config={\n        \"served_entities\": [\n          {\n            \"name\": \"openai-completions\",\n            \"external_model\": {\n                \"name\": \"gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct\",\n                \"provider\": \"openai\",\n                \"task\": \"llm/v1/completions\",\n                \"openai_config\": {\n                    \"openai_api_type\": \"azure\",\n                    \"openai_api_key\": \"{{secrets/my_openai_secret_scope/openai_api_key}}\",\n                    \"openai_api_base\": \"https://my-azure-openai-endpoint.openai.azure.com\",\n                    \"openai_deployment_name\": \"my-gpt-35-turbo-deployment\",\n                    \"openai_api_version\": \"2023-05-15\"\n                },\n            },\n          }\n        ],\n    },\n)\n\n\nTo update an endpoint, use update_endpoint(). The following code snippet demonstrates how to update an endpoint’s rate limits to 20 calls per minute per user.\n\nCopy\nPython\nclient.update_endpoint(\n    endpoint=\"openai-completions-endpoint\",\n    config={\n        \"rate_limits\": [\n            {\n                \"key\": \"user\",\n                \"renewal_period\": \"minute\",\n                \"calls\": 20\n            }\n        ],\n    },\n)\n\nStep 3: Send requests to an external model endpoint\n\nImportant\n\nThe code examples in this section demonstrate usage of the MLflow Deployments SDK’s predict() method.\n\nYou can send chat, completions, and embeddings requests to an external model endpoint using the MLflow Deployments SDK’s predict() method.\n\nThe following sends a request to gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct hosted by OpenAI.\n\nCopy\nPython\ncompletions_response = client.predict(\n    endpoint=\"openai-completions-endpoint\",\n    inputs={\n        \"prompt\": \"What is the capital of France?\",\n        \"temperature\": 0.1,\n        \"max_tokens\": 10,\n        \"n\": 2\n    }\n)\ncompletions_response == {\n    \"id\": \"cmpl-8QW0hdtUesKmhB3a1Vel6X25j2MDJ\",\n    \"object\": \"text_completion\",\n    \"created\": 1701330267,\n    \"model\": \"gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct\",\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"text\": \"The capital of France is Paris.\",\n            \"index\": 0,\n            \"finish_reason\": \"stop\",\n            \"logprobs\": None\n        },\n        {\n            \"text\": \"Paris is the capital of France\",\n            \"index\": 1,\n            \"finish_reason\": \"stop\",\n            \"logprobs\": None\n        },\n    ],\n    \"usage\": {\n        \"prompt_tokens\": 7,\n        \"completion_tokens\": 16,\n        \"total_tokens\": 23\n    }\n}\n\nStep 4: Compare models from a different provider\n\nModel serving supports many external model providers including Open AI, Anthropic, Cohere, Amazon Bedrock, Google Cloud Vertex AI, and more. You can compare LLMs across providers, helping you optimize the accuracy, speed, and cost of your applications using the AI Playground.\n\nThe following example creates an endpoint for Anthropic claude-2 and compares its response to a question that uses OpenAI gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct. Both responses have the same standard format, which makes them easy to compare.\n\nCreate an endpoint for Anthropic claude-2\nCopy\nPython\nimport mlflow.deployments\n\nclient = mlflow.deployments.get_deploy_client(\"databricks\")\n\nclient.create_endpoint(\n    name=\"anthropic-completions-endpoint\",\n    config={\n        \"served_entities\": [\n            {\n                \"name\": \"claude-completions\",\n                \"external_model\": {\n                    \"name\": \"claude-2\",\n                    \"provider\": \"anthropic\",\n                    \"task\": \"llm/v1/completions\",\n                    \"anthropic_config\": {\n                        \"anthropic_api_key\": \"{{secrets/my_anthropic_secret_scope/anthropic_api_key}}\"\n                    },\n                },\n            }\n        ],\n    },\n)\n\nCompare the responses from each endpoint\nCopy\nPython\n\nopenai_response = client.predict(\n    endpoint=\"openai-completions-endpoint\",\n    inputs={\n        \"prompt\": \"How is Pi calculated? Be very concise.\"\n    }\n)\nanthropic_response = client.predict(\n    endpoint=\"anthropic-completions-endpoint\",\n    inputs={\n        \"prompt\": \"How is Pi calculated?

Route optimized serving endpoints dramatically lower overhead latency and allow for substantial improvements in the throughput supported by your endpoint.\n\nRoute optimization is recommended for high throughput or latency sensitive workloads.\n\nRequirements\n\nFor route optimization on a model serving endpoint, see Requirements.\n\nFor route optimization on a feature serving endpoint, see Requirements.\n\nEnable route optimization on a model serving endpoint\n\nSpecify the route_optimized parameter during model serving endpoint creation to configure your endpoint for route optimization. You can only specify this parameter during endpoint creation, you can not update existing endpoints to be route optimized.\n\nCopy\nBash\nPOST /api/2.0/serving-endpoints\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"my-endpoint\",\n  \"config\":{\n    \"served_entities\": [{\n      \"entity_name\": \"ads1\",\n      \"entity_version\": \"1\",\n      \"workload_type\": \"CPU\",\n      \"workload_size\": \"Small\",\n      \"scale_to_zero_enabled\": true,\n    }],\n  },\n  \"route_optimized\": true\n}\n\n\nYou can enable route optimization for an endpoint in the Serving UI. If you use Python, you can use the following notebook to create a route optimized serving endpoint.\n\nCreate a route optimized serving endpoint using Python notebook\n\nOpen notebook in new tab\n Copy link for import\n\nLoading notebook...\nEnable route optimization on a feature serving endpoint\n\nTo use route optimization for Feature and Function Serving, specify the full name of the feature specification in the entity_name field for serving endpoint creation requests. The entity_version is not needed for FeatureSpecs.\n\nCopy\nBash\nPOST /api/2.0/serving-endpoints\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"my-endpoint\",\n  \"config\": {\n    \"served_entities\": [\n      {\n        \"entity_name\": \"catalog_name.schema_name.feature_spec_name\",\n        \"workload_type\": \"CPU\",\n        \"workload_size\": \"Small\",\n        \"scale_to_zero_enabled\": true\n      }\n    ]\n  },\n  \"route_optimized\": true\n}\n\nQuery route optimized model serving endpoints\n\nThe following steps show how to test query a route optimized model serving endpoint.\n\nFor production use, like using your route optimized endpoint in an application, you must create an OAuth token. The following steps show how to fetch a token in the Serving UI. For programmatic workflows, see Fetch an OAuth token programmatically.\n\nFetch an OAuth token from the Serving UI of your workspace.\n\nClick Serving in the sidebar to display the Serving UI.\n\nOn the Serving endpoints page, select your route optimized endpoint to see endpoint details.\n\nOn the endpoint details page, click the Query endpoint button.\n\nSelect the Fetch Token tab.\n\nSelect Fetch OAuth Token button. This token is valid for 1 hour. Fetch a new token if your current token expires.\n\nGet your model serving endpoint URL from the endpoint details page from the Serving UI.\n\nUse the OAuth token from step 1 and the endpoint URL from step 2 to populate the following example code that queries the route optimized endpoint.\n\nCopy\nBash\nurl=\"your-endpoint-url\"\nOAUTH_TOKEN=xxxxxxx\n\ncurl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H \"Authorization: Bearer $OAUTH_TOKEN\" -d@data.json $url\n\n\nFor a Python SDK to query a route optimized endpoint, reach out to your Databricks account team.\n\nFetch an OAuth token programmatically\n\nAuthenticate access to Databricks with a service principal using OAuth (OAuth M2M) provides guidance on how to fetch an OAuth token programmatically. In addition to those steps, you must specify authorization_details in the request.\n\nReplace <token-endpoint-URL> with the preceding token endpoint URL.\n\nReplace <client-id> with the service principal’s client ID, which is also known as an application ID.\n\nReplace <client-secret> with the service principal’s OAuth secret that you created.\n\nReplace <endpoint-id> with the endpoint ID of the route optimized endpoint. You can fetch this from hostName in the endpoint url.\n\nReplace <action> with the action permission given to the service principal. The action can be query_inference_endpoint or manage_inference_endpoint.\n\nFor example:\n\nCopy\nBash\n      export CLIENT_ID=<client-id>\n      export CLIENT_SECRET=<client-secret>\n      export ENDPOINT_ID=<endpoint-id>\n      export ACTION=<action>\n\n      curl --request POST \\\n      --url <token-endpoint-URL> \\\n      --user \"$CLIENT_ID:$CLIENT_SECRET\" \\\n      --data 'grant_type=client_credentials&scope=all-apis'\n      --data-urlencode 'authorization_details=[{\"type\":\"workspace_permission\",\"object_type\":\"serving-endpoints\",\"object_path\":\"'\"/serving-endpoints/$ENDPOINT_ID\"'\",\"actions\": [\"'\"$ACTION\"'\"]}]'\n\nLimitations\n\nRoute optimization is only available for custom model serving endpoints and feature serving endpoints.

A vector database is a database that is optimized to store and retrieve embeddings. Embeddings are mathematical representations of the semantic content of data, typically text or image data. Embeddings are generated by a large language model and are a key component of many GenAI applications that depend on finding documents or images that are similar to each other. Examples are RAG systems, recommender systems, and image and video recognition.\n\nWith Mosaic AI Vector Search, you create a vector search index from a Delta table. The index includes embedded data with metadata. You can then query the index using a REST API to identify the most similar vectors and return the associated documents. You can structure the index to automatically sync when the underlying Delta table is updated.\n\nMosaic AI Vector Search supports the following:\n\nHybrid keyword-similarity search.\n\nFiltering.\n\nAccess control lists (ACLs) to manage vector search endpoints.\n\nSync only selected columns.\n\nSave and sync generated embeddings.\n\nHow does Mosaic AI Vector Search work?\n\nMosaic AI Vector Search uses the Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) algorithm for its approximate nearest neighbor searches and the L2 distance distance metric to measure embedding vector similarity. If you want to use cosine similarity you need to normalize your datapoint embeddings before feeding them into vector search. When the data points are normalized, the ranking produced by L2 distance is the same as the ranking produces by cosine similarity.\n\nMosaic AI Vector Search also supports hybrid keyword-similarity search, which combines vector-based embedding search with traditional keyword-based search techniques. This approach matches exact words in the query while also using a vector-based similarity search to capture the semantic relationships and context of the query.\n\nBy integrating these two techniques, hybrid keyword-similarity search retrieves documents that contain not only the exact keywords but also those that are conceptually similar, providing more comprehensive and relevant search results. This method is particularly useful in RAG applications where source data has unique keywords such as SKUs or identifiers that are not well suited to pure similarity search.\n\nFor details about the API, see the Python SDK reference and Query a vector search endpoint.\n\nSimilarity search calculation\n\nThe similarity search calculation uses the following formula:\n\nwhere dist is the Euclidean distance between the query q and the index entry x:\n\nKeyword search algorithm\n\nRelevance scores are calculated using Okapi BM25. All text or string columns are searched, including the source text embedding and metadata columns in text or string format. The tokenization function splits at word boundaries, removes punctuation, and converts all text to lowercase.\n\nHow similarity search and keyword search are combined\n\nThe similarity search and keyword search results are combined using the Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) function.\n\nRRF rescores each document from each method using the score:\n\nIn the above equation, rank starts at 0, sums the scores for each document and returns the highest scoring documents.\n\nrrf_param controls the relative importance of higher-ranked and lower-ranked documents. Based on the literature, rrf_param is set to 60.\n\nScores are normalized so that the highest score is 1 and the lowest score is 0 using the following equation:\n\nOptions for providing vector embeddings\n\nTo create a vector database in Databricks, you must first decide how to provide vector embeddings. Databricks supports three options:\n\nOption 1: Delta Sync Index with embeddings computed by Databricks You provide a source Delta table that contains data in text format. Databricks calculates the embeddings, using a model that you specify, and optionally saves the embeddings to a table in Unity Catalog. As the Delta table is updated, the index stays synced with the Delta table.\n\nThe following diagram illustrates the process:\n\nCalculate query embeddings. Query can include metadata filters.\n\nPerform similarity search to identify most relevant documents.\n\nReturn the most relevant documents and append them to the query.\n\nOption 2: Delta Sync Index with self-managed embeddings You provide a source Delta table that contains pre-calculated embeddings. As the Delta table is updated, the index stays synced with the Delta table.\n\nThe following diagram illustrates the process:\n\nQuery consists of embeddings and can include metadata filters.\n\nPerform similarity search to identify most relevant documents. Return the most relevant documents and append them to the query.\n\nOption 3: Direct Vector Access Index You must manually update the index using the REST API when the embeddings table changes.\n\nThe following diagram illustrates the process:\n\nHow to set up Mosaic AI Vector Search\n\nTo use Mosaic AI Vector Search, you must create the following:\n\nA vector search endpoint. This endpoint serves the vector search index. You can query and update the endpoint using the REST API or the SDK. See Create a vector search endpoint for instructions.\n\nEndpoints scale up automatically to support the size of the index or the number of concurrent requests. Endpoints do not scale down automatically.\n\nA vector search index. The vector search index is created from a Delta table and is optimized to provide real-time approximate nearest neighbor searches. The goal of the search is to identify documents that are similar to the query. Vector search indexes appear in and are governed by Unity Catalog. See Create a vector search index for instructions.\n\nIn addition, if you choose to have Databricks compute the embeddings, you can use a pre-configured Foundation Model APIs endpoint or create a model serving endpoint to serve the embedding model of your choice. See Pay-per-token Foundation Model APIs or Create foundation model serving endpoints for instructions.\n\nTo query the model serving endpoint, you use either the REST API or the Python SDK. Your query can define filters based on any column in the Delta table. For details, see Use filters on queries, the API reference, or the Python SDK reference.\n\nRequirements\n\nUnity Catalog enabled workspace.\n\nServerless compute enabled. For instructions, see Connect to serverless compute.\n\nSource table must have Change Data Feed enabled. For instructions, see Use Delta Lake change data feed on Databricks.\n\nTo create a vector search index, you must have CREATE TABLE privileges on the catalog schema where the index will be created.\n\nPermission to create and manage vector search endpoints is configured using access control lists. See Vector search endpoint ACLs.\n\nData protection and authentication\n\nDatabricks implements the following security controls to protect your data:\n\nEvery customer request to Mosaic AI Vector Search is logically isolated, authenticated, and authorized.\n\nMosaic AI Vector Search encrypts all data at rest (AES-256) and in transit (TLS 1.2+).\n\nMosaic AI Vector Search supports two modes of authentication:\n\nService principal token. An admin can generate a service principal token and pass it to the SDK or API. See use service principals. For production use cases, Databricks recommends using a service principal token.\n\nCopy\nPython\n# Pass in a service principal\nvsc = VectorSearchClient(workspace_url=\"...\",\n        service_principal_client_id=\"...\",\n        service_principal_client_secret=\"...\"\n        )\n\n\nPersonal access token. You can use a personal access token to authenticate with Mosaic AI Vector Search. See personal access authentication token. If you use the SDK in a notebook environment, the SDK automatically generates a PAT token for authentication.\n\nCopy\nPython\n# Pass in the PAT token\nclient = VectorSearchClient(workspace_url=\"...\", personal_access_token=\"...\")\n\n\nCustomer Managed Keys (CMK) are supported on endpoints created on or after May 8, 2024.\n\nMonitor usage and costs\n\nThe billable usage system table lets you monitor usage and costs associated with vector search indexes and endpoints. Here is an example query:\n\nCopy\nSQL\nWITH all_vector_search_usage (\n  SELECT *,\n         CASE WHEN usage_metadata.endpoint_name IS NULL\n              THEN 'ingest'\n              ELSE 'serving'\n        END as workload_type\n    FROM system.billing.usage\n   WHERE billing_origin_product = 'VECTOR_SEARCH'\n),\ndaily_dbus AS (\n  SELECT workspace_id,\n       cloud,\n       usage_date,\n       workload_type,\n       usage_metadata.endpoint_name as vector_search_endpoint,\n       SUM(usage_quantity) as dbus\n FROM all_vector_search_usage\n GROUP BY all\nORDER BY 1,2,3,4,5 DESC\n)\nSELECT * FROM daily_dbus\n\n\nFor details about the contents of the billing usage table, see Billable usage system table reference.

AI Gateway brings governance, monitoring, and production readiness to these model serving endpoints. See Mosaic AI Gateway.\n\nExternal models are third-party models hosted outside of Databricks. Supported by Model Serving, external models allow you to streamline the usage and management of various large language model (LLM) providers, such as OpenAI and Anthropic, within an organization. You can also use Mosaic AI Model Serving as a provider to serve custom models, which offers rate limits for those endpoints. As part of this support, Model Serving offers a high-level interface that simplifies the interaction with these services by providing a unified endpoint to handle specific LLM-related requests.\n\nIn addition, Databricks support for external models provides centralized credential management. By storing API keys in one secure location, organizations can enhance their security posture by minimizing the exposure of sensitive API keys throughout the system. It also helps to prevent exposing these keys within code or requiring end users to manage keys safely.\n\nSee Tutorial: Create external model endpoints to query OpenAI models for step-by-step guidance on external model endpoint creation and querying supported models served by those endpoints using the MLflow Deployments SDK. See the following guides for instructions on how to use the Serving UI and the REST API:\n\nCreate custom model serving endpoints\n\nQuery foundation models\n\nRequirements\n\nAPI key or authentication fields for the model provider.\n\nDatabricks workspace in External models supported regions.\n\nModel providers\n\nExternal models in Model Serving is designed to support a variety of model providers. A provider represents the source of the machine learning models, such as OpenAI, Anthropic, and so on. Each provider has its specific characteristics and configurations that are encapsulated within the external_model field of the external model endpoint configuration.\n\nThe following providers are supported:\n\nopenai: For models offered by OpenAI and the Azure integrations for Azure OpenAI and Azure OpenAI with AAD.\n\nanthropic: For models offered by Anthropic.\n\ncohere: For models offered by Cohere.\n\namazon-bedrock: For models offered by Amazon Bedrock.\n\ngoogle-cloud-vertex-ai: For models offered by Google Cloud Vertex AI.\n\ndatabricks-model-serving: For Mosaic AI Model Serving endpoints with compatible schemas. See Endpoint configuration.\n\nTo request support for a provider not listed here, reach out to your Databricks account team.\n\nSupported models\n\nThe model you choose directly affects the results of the responses you get from the API calls. Therefore, choose a model that fits your use-case requirements. For instance, for generating conversational responses, you can choose a chat model. Conversely, for generating embeddings of text, you can choose an embedding model.\n\nSee supported models.\n\nUse models served on Mosaic AI Model Serving endpoints\n\nMosaic AI Model Serving endpoints as a provider is supported for the llm/v1/completions, llm/v1/chat, and llm/v1/embeddings endpoint types. These endpoints must accept the standard query parameters marked as required, while other parameters might be ignored depending on whether or not the Mosaic AI Model Serving endpoint supports them.\n\nSee POST /serving-endpoints/{name}/invocations in the API reference for standard query parameters.\n\nThese endpoints must produce responses in the following OpenAI format.\n\nFor completions tasks:\n\nCopy\nPython\n{\n\"id\": \"123\", # Not Required\n\"model\": \"test_databricks_model\",\n\"choices\": [\n  {\n    \"text\": \"Hello World!\",\n    \"index\": 0,\n    \"logprobs\": null, # Not Required\n    \"finish_reason\": \"length\" # Not Required\n  }\n],\n\"usage\": {\n  \"prompt_tokens\": 8,\n  \"total_tokens\": 8\n  }\n}\n\n\nFor chat tasks:\n\nCopy\nPython\n{\n  \"id\": \"123\", # Not Required\n  \"model\": \"test_chat_model\",\n  \"choices\": [{\n    \"index\": 0,\n    \"message\": {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"\\n\\nHello there, how may I assist you today?\",\n    },\n    \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"index\": 1,\n    \"message\": {\n      \"role\": \"human\",\n      \"content\": \"\\n\\nWhat is the weather in San Francisco?\",\n    },\n    \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"\n  }],\n  \"usage\": {\n    \"prompt_tokens\": 8,\n    \"total_tokens\": 8\n  }\n}\n\n\nFor embeddings tasks:\n\nCopy\nPython\n{\n  \"data\": [\n    {\n      \"embedding\": [\n        0.0023064255,\n        -0.009327292,\n        .... # (1536 floats total for ada-002)\n        -0.0028842222,\n      ],\n      \"index\": 0\n    },\n    {\n      \"embedding\": [\n        0.0023064255,\n        -0.009327292,\n        .... #(1536 floats total for ada-002)\n        -0.0028842222,\n      ],\n      \"index\": 0\n    }\n  ],\n  \"model\": \"test_embedding_model\",\n  \"usage\": {\n    \"prompt_tokens\": 8,\n    \"total_tokens\": 8\n  }\n}\n\nEndpoint configuration\n\nTo serve and query external models you need to configure a serving endpoint. See Create an external model serving endpoint\n\nFor an external model serving endpoint, you must include the external_model field and its parameters in the served_entities section of the endpoint configuration. If you configure multiple external models in a serving endpoint, you must provide a traffic_config to define the traffic routing percentage for each external model.\n\nThe external_model field defines the model to which this endpoint forwards requests. When specifying a model, it is critical that the provider supports the model you are requesting. For instance, openai as a provider supports models like text-embedding-ada-002, but other providers might not. If the model is not supported by the provider, Databricks returns an HTTP 4xx error when trying to route requests to that model.\n\nThe below table summarizes the external_model field parameters. See POST /api/2.0/serving-endpoints for endpoint configuration parameters.\n\nParameter\n\n\t\n\nDescriptions\n\n\n\n\nname\n\n\t\n\nThe name of the model to use. For example, gpt-3.5-turbo for OpenAI’s GPT-3.5-Turbo model.\n\n\n\n\nprovider\n\n\t\n\nSpecifies the name of the provider for this model. This string value must correspond to a supported external model provider. For example, openai for OpenAI’s GPT-3.5 models.\n\n\n\n\ntask\n\n\t\n\nThe task corresponds to the type of language model interaction you desire. Supported tasks are “llm/v1/completions”, “llm/v1/chat”, “llm/v1/embeddings”.\n\n\n\n\n<provider>_config\n\n\t\n\nContains any additional configuration details required for the model. This includes specifying the API base URL and the API key. See Configure the provider for an endpoint.\n\nThe following is an example of creating an external model endpoint using the create_endpoint() API. In this example, a request sent to the completion endpoint is forwarded to the claude-2 model provided by anthropic.\n\nCopy\nPython\nimport mlflow.deployments\n\nclient = mlflow.deployments.get_deploy_client(\"databricks\")\n\nclient.create_endpoint(\n    name=\"anthropic-completions-endpoint\",\n    config={\n        \"served_entities\": [\n            {\n                \"name\": \"test\",\n                \"external_model\": {\n                    \"name\": \"claude-2\",\n                    \"provider\": \"anthropic\",\n                    \"task\": \"llm/v1/completions\",\n                    \"anthropic_config\": {\n                        \"anthropic_api_key\": \"{{secrets/my_anthropic_secret_scope/anthropic_api_key}}\"\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n)\n\nConfigure the provider for an endpoint\n\nWhen you create an endpoint, you must supply the required configurations for the specified model provider. The following sections summarize the available endpoint configuration parameters for each model provider.\n\nNote\n\nDatabricks encrypts and securely stores the provided credentials for each model provider. These credentials are automatically deleted when their associated endpoints are deleted.\n\nOpenAI\n\nConfiguration Parameter\n\n\t\n\nDescription\n\n\t\n\nRequired\n\n\t\n\nDefault\n\n\n\n\nopenai_api_key\n\n\t\n\nThe Databricks secret key reference for an OpenAI API key using the OpenAI service.

See Register the agent to Unity Catalog.\n\nDeploying agents from outside a Databricks notebook requires databricks-agents SDK version 0.12.0 or above.\n\nInstall the the databricks-agents SDK.\n\nCopy\nPython\n%pip install databricks-agents\ndbutils.library.restartPython()\n\nDeploy an agent using deploy()\n\nThe deploy() function does the following:\n\nCreates CPU model serving endpoints for your agent that can be integrated into your user-facing application.\n\nTo reduce cost for idle endpoints (at the expense of increased time to serve initial queries), you can enable scale to zero for your serving endpoint by passing scale_to_zero_enabled=True to deploy(). See Endpoint scaling expectations.\n\nInference tables are enabled on these Model Serving endpoints. See Inference tables for monitoring and debugging models.\n\nDatabricks automatically provides short-lived service principal credentials to agent code running in the endpoint. The credentials have the minimum permissions to access Databricks-managed resources as defined during model logging. Before generating these credentials, Databricks ensures that the endpoint owner has the appropriate permissions to prevent privilege escalation and unauthorized access. See Authentication for dependent resources.\n\nIf you have resource dependencies that are not Databricks-managed, for example, using Pinecone, you can pass in environment variables with secrets to the deploy() API. See Configure access to resources from model serving endpoints.\n\nEnables the Review App for your agent. The Review App lets stakeholders chat with the agent and give feedback using the Review App UI.\n\nLogs every request to the Review App or REST API to an inference table. The data logged includes query requests, responses, and intermediate trace data from MLflow Tracing.\n\nCreates a feedback model with the same catalog and schema as the agent you are trying to deploy. This feedback model is the mechanism that makes it possible to accept feedback from the Review App and log it to an inference table. This model is served in the same CPU model serving endpoint as your deployed agent. Because this serving endpoint has inference tables enabled, it is possible to log feedback from the Review App to an inference table.\n\nNote\n\nDeployments can take up to 15 minutes to complete. Raw JSON payloads take 10 - 30 minutes to arrive, and the formatted logs are processed from the raw payloads about every hour.\n\nCopy\nPython\n\nfrom databricks.agents import deploy\nfrom mlflow.utils import databricks_utils as du\n\ndeployment = deploy(model_fqn, uc_model_info.version)\n\n# query_endpoint is the URL that can be used to make queries to the app\ndeployment.query_endpoint\n\n# Copy deployment.rag_app_url to browser and start interacting with your RAG application.\ndeployment.rag_app_url\n\nAgent-enhanced inference tables\n\nThe deploy() creates three inference tables for each deployment to log requests and responses to and from the agent serving endpoint. Users can expect the data to be in the payload table within an hour of interacting with their deployment.\n\nPayload request logs and assessment logs might take longer to populate, but are ultimately derived from the raw payload table. You can extract request and assessment logs from the payload table yourself.

For example, an agent may need to access a Vector Search index to query unstructured data.\n\nYour agent can use one of the following methods to authenticate to dependent resources when you serve it behind a Model Serving endpoint:\n\nAutomatic authentication passthrough: Declare Databricks resource dependencies for your agent during logging. Databricks can automatically provision, rotate, and manage short-lived credentials when your agent is deployed to securely access resources. Databricks recommends using automatic authentication passthrough where possible.\n\nManual authentication: Manually specify long-lived credentials during agent deployment. Use manual authentication for Databricks resources that do not support automatic authentication passthrough, or for external API access.\n\nAutomatic authentication passthrough\n\nModel Serving supports automatic authentication passthrough for the most common types of Databricks resources used by agents.\n\nTo enable automatic authentication passthrough, you must specify dependencies during agent logging.\n\nThen, when you serve the agent behind an endpoint, Databricks performs the following steps:\n\nPermission verification: Databricks verifies that the endpoint creator can access all dependencies specified during agent logging.\n\nService principal creation and grants: A service principal is created for the agent model version and is automatically granted read access to agent resources.\n\nNote\n\nThe system-generated service principal does not appear in API or UI listings. If the agent model version is removed from the endpoint, the service principal is also deleted.\n\nCredential provisioning and rotation: Short-lived credentials (an M2M OAuth token) for the service principal are injected into the endpoint, allowing agent code to access Databricks resources. Databricks also rotates the credentials, ensuring that your agent has continued, secure access to dependent resources.\n\nThis authentication behavior is similar to the “Run as owner” behavior for Databricks dashboards - downstream resources like Unity Catalog tables are accessed using the credentials of a service principal with least-privilege access to dependent resources.\n\nThe following table lists the Databricks resources that support automatic authentication passthrough and the permissions the endpoint creator must have when deploying the agent.\n\nNote\n\nUnity Catalog resources also require USE SCHEMA on the parent schema and USE CATALOG on the parent catalog.\n\nResource type\n\n\t\n\nPermission\n\n\n\n\nSQL Warehouse\n\n\t\n\nUse Endpoint\n\n\n\n\nModel Serving endpoint\n\n\t\n\nCan Query\n\n\n\n\nUnity Catalog Function\n\n\t\n\nEXECUTE\n\n\n\n\nGenie space\n\n\t\n\nCan Run\n\n\n\n\nVector Search index\n\n\t\n\nCan Use\n\n\n\n\nUnity Catalog Table\n\n\t\n\nSELECT\n\nManual authentication\n\nYou can also manually provide credentials using secrets-based environment variables. Manual authentication can be helpful in the following scenarios:\n\nThe dependent resource does not support automatic authentication passthrough.\n\nThe agent is accessing an external resource or API.\n\nThe agent needs to use credentials other than those of the agent deployer.\n\nFor example, to use the Databricks SDK in your agent to access other dependent resources, you can set the environment variables described in Databricks client unified authentication.\n\nGet deployed applications\n\nThe following shows how to get your deployed agents.\n\nCopy\nPython\nfrom databricks.agents import list_deployments, get_deployments\n\n# Get the deployment for specific model_fqn and version\ndeployment = get_deployments(model_name=model_fqn, model_version=model_version.version)\n\ndeployments = list_deployments()\n# Print all the current deployments\ndeployments\n\nProvide feedback on a deployed agent (experimental)\n\nWhen you deploy your agent with agents.deploy(), agent framework also creates and deploys a “feedback” model version within the same endpoint, which you can query to provide feedback on your agent application. Feedback entries appear as request rows within the inference table associated with your agent serving endpoint.\n\nNote that this behavior is experimental: Databricks may provide a first-class API for providing feedback on a deployed agent in the future, and future functionality may require migrating to this API.\n\nLimitations of this API include:\n\nThe feedback API lacks input validation - it always responds successfully, even if passed invalid input.\n\nThe feedback API requires passing in the Databricks-generated request_id of the agent endpoint request on which you wish to provide feedback. To get the databricks_request_id, include {\"databricks_options\": {\"return_trace\": True}} in your original request to the agent serving endpoint. The agent endpoint response will then include the databricks_request_id associated with the request so that you can pass that request ID back to the feedback API when providing feedback on the agent response.\n\nFeedback is collected using inference tables. See inference table limitations.\n\nThe following example request provides feedback on the agent endpoint named “your-agent-endpoint-name”, and assumes that the DATABRICKS_TOKEN environment variable is set to a Databricks REST API token.\n\nCopy\nBash\ncurl \\\n  -u token:$DATABRICKS_TOKEN \\\n  -X POST \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -d '\n      {\n          \"dataframe_records\": [\n              {\n                  \"source\": {\n                      \"id\": \"user@company.com\",\n                      \"type\": \"human\"\n                  },\n                  \"request_id\": \"573d4a61-4adb-41bd-96db-0ec8cebc3744\",\n                  \"text_assessments\": [\n                      {\n                          \"ratings\": {\n                              \"answer_correct\": {\n                                  \"value\": \"positive\"\n                              },\n                              \"accurate\": {\n                                  \"value\": \"positive\"\n                              }\n                          },\n                          \"free_text_comment\": \"The answer used the provided context to talk about Delta Live Tables\"\n                      }\n                  ],\n                  \"retrieval_assessments\": [\n                      {\n                          \"ratings\": {\n                              \"groundedness\": {\n                                  \"value\": \"positive\"\n                              }\n                          }\n                      }\n                  ]\n              }\n          ]\n      }' \\\nhttps://<workspace-host>.databricks.com/serving-endpoints/<your-agent-endpoint-name>/served-models/feedback/invocations\n\n\nYou can pass additional or different key-value pairs in the text_assessments.ratings and retrieval_assessments.ratings fields to provide different types of feedback. In the example, the feedback payload indicates that the agent’s response to the request with ID 573d4a61-4adb-41bd-96db-0ec8cebc3744 was correct, accurate, and grounded in context fetched by a retriever tool.\n\nAdditional resources\n\nWhat is Mosaic AI Agent Evaluation?\n\nGet feedback about the quality of an agentic application\n\n© Databricks 2025.

The model must be registered in Unity Catalog or in the workspace model registry.\n\nTo learn about serving and deploying generative AI models instead, see the following articles:\n\nExternal Models\n\nFoundation Model API\n\nStep 1: Log the model\n\nThere are different ways to log your model for model serving:\n\nLogging technique\n\n\t\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nAutologging\n\n\t\n\nThis is automatically turned on when you use Databricks Runtime for machine learning. It’s the easiest way but gives you less control.\n\n\n\n\nLogging using MLflow’s built-in flavors\n\n\t\n\nYou can manually log the model with MLflow’s built-in model flavors.\n\n\n\n\nCustom logging with pyfunc\n\n\t\n\nUse this if you have a custom model or if you need extra steps before or after inference.\n\nThe following example shows how to log your MLflow model using the transformer flavor and specify parameters you need for your model.\n\nCopy\nPython\nwith mlflow.start_run():\n    model_info = mlflow.transformers.log_model(\n        transformers_model=text_generation_pipeline,\n        artifact_path=\"my_sentence_generator\",\n        inference_config=inference_config,\n        registered_model_name='gpt2',\n        input_example=input_example,\n        signature=signature\n    )\n\n\nAfter your model is logged be sure to check that your model is registered in either Unity Catalog or the MLflow Model Registry.\n\nStep 2: Create endpoint using the Serving UI\n\nAfter your registered model is logged and you are ready to serve it, you can create a model serving endpoint using the Serving UI.\n\nClick Serving in the sidebar to display the Serving UI.\n\nClick Create serving endpoint.\n\nIn the Name field, provide a name for your endpoint.\n\nIn the Served entities section\n\nClick into the Entity field to open the Select served entity form.\n\nSelect the type of model you want to serve. The form dynamically updates based on your selection.\n\nSelect which model and model version you want to serve.\n\nSelect the percentage of traffic to route to your served model.\n\nSelect what size compute to use.\n\nUnder Compute Scale-out, select the size of the compute scale out that corresponds with the number of requests this served model can process at the same time. This number should be roughly equal to QPS x model execution time.\n\nAvailable sizes are Small for 0-4 requests, Medium 8-16 requests, and Large for 16-64 requests.\n\nSpecify if the endpoint should scale to zero when not in use.\n\nClick Create. The Serving endpoints page appears with Serving endpoint state shown as Not Ready.\n\nIf you prefer to create an endpoint programmatically with the Databricks Serving API, see Create custom model serving endpoints.\n\nStep 3: Query the endpoint\n\nThe easiest and fastest way to test and send scoring requests to your served model is to use the Serving UI.\n\nFrom the Serving endpoint page, select Query endpoint.\n\nInsert the model input data in JSON format and click Send Request. If the model has been logged with an input example, click Show Example to load the input example.\n\nCopy\nPython\n   {\n   \"inputs\" : [\"Hello, I'm a language model,\"],\n   \"params\" : {\"max_new_tokens\": 10, \"temperature\": 1}\n   }\n\n\nTo send scoring requests, construct a JSON with one of the supported keys and a JSON object corresponding to the input format. See Query serving endpoints for custom models for supported formats and guidance on how to send scoring requests using the API.\n\nIf you plan to access your serving endpoint outside of the Databricks Serving UI, you need a DATABRICKS_API_TOKEN.\n\nImportant\n\nAs a security best practice for production scenarios, Databricks recommends that you use machine-to-machine OAuth tokens for authentication during production.\n\nFor testing and development, Databricks recommends using a personal access token belonging to service principals instead of workspace users. To create tokens for service principals, see Manage tokens for a service principal.\n\nExample notebooks\n\nSee the following notebook for serving a MLflow transformers model with Model Serving.\n\nDeploy a Hugging Face `transformers` model notebook\n\nOpen notebook in new tab\n Copy link for import\n\nLoading notebook...\n\nSee the following notebook for serving a MLflow pyfunc model with Model Serving.

Agent Evaluation helps developers evaluate the quality, cost, and latency of agentic AI applications, including RAG applications and chains. Agent Evaluation is designed to both identify quality issues and determine the root cause of those issues. The capabilities of Agent Evaluation are unified across the development, staging, and production phases of the MLOps life cycle, and all evaluation metrics and data are logged to MLflow Runs.\n\nAgent Evaluation integrates advanced, research-backed evaluation techniques into a user-friendly SDK and UI that is integrated with your lakehouse, MLflow, and the other Databricks Data Intelligence Platform components. Developed in collaboration with Mosaic AI research, this proprietary technology offers a comprehensive approach to analyzing and enhancing agent performance.\n\nAgentic AI applications are complex and involve many different components. Evaluating the performance of these applications is not as straightforward as evaluating the performance of traditional ML models. Both qualitative and quantitative metrics that are used to evaluate quality are inherently more complex. Agent Evaluation includes proprietary LLM judges and agent metrics to evaluate retrieval and request quality as well as overall performance metrics like latency and token cost.\n\nHow do I use Agent Evaluation?\n\nThe following code shows how to call and test Agent Evaluation on previously generated outputs. It returns a dataframe with evaluation scores calculated by LLM judges that are part of Agent Evaluation.\n\nYou can copy and paste the following into your existing Databricks notebook:\n\nCopy\nPython\n%pip install mlflow databricks-agents\ndbutils.library.restartPython()\n\nimport mlflow\nimport pandas as pd\n\nexamples =  {\n    \"request\": [\n      {\n      # Recommended `messages` format\n        \"messages\": [{\n          \"role\": \"user\",\n          \"content\": \"Spark is a data analytics framework.\"\n        }],\n      },\n      # SplitChatMessagesRequest format\n      {\n        \"query\": \"How do I convert a Spark DataFrame to Pandas?\",\n        \"history\": [\n          {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"What is Spark?\"},\n          {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"Spark is a data processing engine.\"},\n        ],\n      }\n      # Note: Using a primitive string is discouraged. The string will be wrapped in the\n      # OpenAI messages format before being passed to your agent.\n    ],\n    \"response\": [\n        \"Spark is a data analytics framework.\",\n        \"This is not possible as Spark is not a panda.\",\n    ],\n    \"retrieved_context\": [ # Optional, needed for judging groundedness.\n        [{\"doc_uri\": \"doc1.txt\", \"content\": \"In 2013, Spark, a data analytics framework, was open sourced by UC Berkeley's AMPLab.\"}],\n        [{\"doc_uri\": \"doc2.txt\", \"content\": \"To convert a Spark DataFrame to Pandas, you can use toPandas()\"}],\n    ],\n    \"expected_response\": [ # Optional, needed for judging correctness.\n        \"Spark is a data analytics framework.\",\n        \"To convert a Spark DataFrame to Pandas, you can use the toPandas() method.\",\n    ],\n    \"guidelines\": [\n        \"The response must be in English\",\n        \"The response must be clear, coherent, and concise\",\n    ]\n}\n\nresult = mlflow.evaluate(\n    data=pd.DataFrame(examples),    # Your evaluation set\n    # model=logged_model.model_uri, # If you have an MLFlow model. `retrieved_context` and `response` will be obtained from calling the model.\n    model_type=\"databricks-agent\",  # Enable Mosaic AI Agent Evaluation\n)\n\n# Review the evaluation results in the MLFLow UI (see console output), or access them in place:\ndisplay(result.tables['eval_results'])\n\n\nAlternatively, you can import and run the following notebook in your Databricks workspace:\n\nMosaic AI Agent Evaluation example notebook\n\nOpen notebook in new tab\n Copy link for import\n\nLoading notebook...\nAgent Evaluation inputs and outputs\n\nThe following diagram shows an overview of the inputs accepted by Agent Evaluation and the corresponding outputs produced by Agent Evaluation.\n\nInputs\n\nFor details of the expected input for Agent Evaluation, including field names and data types, see the input schema. Some of the fields are the following:\n\nUser’s query (request): Input to the agent (user’s question or query). For example, “What is RAG?”.\n\nAgent’s response (response): Response generated by the agent. For example, “Retrieval augmented generation is …”.\n\nExpected response (expected_response): (Optional) A ground truth (correct) response.\n\nMLflow trace (trace): (Optional) The agent’s MLflow trace, from which Agent Evaluation extracts intermediate outputs such as the retrieved context or tool calls. Alternatively, you can provide these intermediate outputs directly.\n\nGuidelines (guidelines): (Optional) A list of guidelines that the model’s output is expected to adhere to.\n\nOutputs\n\nBased on these inputs, Agent Evaluation produces two types of outputs:\n\nEvaluation Results (per row): For each row provided as input, Agent Evaluation produces a corresponding output row that contains a detailed assessment of your agent’s quality, cost, and latency.\n\nLLM judges check different aspects of quality, such as correctness or groundedness, outputting a yes/no score and written rationale for that score. For details, see How quality, cost, and latency are assessed by Agent Evaluation.\n\nThe LLM judges’ assessments are combined to produce an overall score that indicates whether that row “passes” (is high quality) or “fails” (has a quality issue).\n\nFor any failing rows, a root cause is identified. Each root cause corresponds to a specific LLM judge’s assessment, allowing you to use the judge’s rationale to identify potential fixes.\n\nCost and latency are extracted from the MLflow trace. For details, see How cost and latency are assessed.\n\nMetrics (aggregate scores): Aggregated scores that summarize the quality, cost, and latency of your agent across all input rows. These include metrics such as the percentage of correct answers, average token count, average latency, and more. For details, see How cost and latency are assessed and How metrics are aggregated at the level of an MLflow run for quality, cost, and latency.\n\nDevelopment (offline evaluation) and production (online monitoring)\n\nAgent Evaluation is designed to be consistent between your development (offline) and production (online) environments. This design enables a smooth transition from development to production, allowing you to quickly iterate, evaluate, deploy, and monitor high-quality agentic applications.\n\nThe main difference between development and production is that in production, you do not have ground-truth labels, while in development, you may optionally use ground-truth labels. Using ground-truth labels allows Agent Evaluation to compute additional quality metrics.\n\nDevelopment (offline)\n\nIn development, your requests and expected_responses come from an evaluation set. An evaluation set is a collection of representative inputs that your agent should be able to handle accurately. For more information about evaluation sets, see Evaluation sets.\n\nTo get response and trace, Agent Evaluation can call your agent’s code to generate these outputs for each row in the evaluation set. Alternatively, you can generate these outputs yourself and pass them to Agent Evaluation. See How to provide input to an evaluation run for more information.\n\nProduction (online)\n\nIn production, all inputs to Agent Evaluation come from your production logs.\n\nIf you use Mosaic AI Agent Framework to deploy your AI application, Agent Evaluation can be configured to automatically collect these inputs from the Agent-enhanced inference tables and continually update a monitoring dashboard. For more details, see How to monitor the quality of your agent on production traffic.\n\nIf you deploy your agent outside of Databricks, you can ETL your logs to the required input schema and similarly configure a monitoring dashboard.\n\nEstablish a quality benchmark with an evaluation set\n\nTo measure the quality of an AI application in development (offline), you need to define an evaluation set, that is, a set of representative questions and optional ground-truth answers. If the application involves a retrieval step, like in RAG workflows, then you can optionally provide supporting documents that you expect the response to be based on.\n\nFor details about evaluation sets, including metric dependencies and best practices, see Evaluation sets.\n\nFor the required schema, see Agent Evaluation input schema.\n\nFor information about how to synthetically generate a high-quality evaluation set, see Synthesize evaluation sets.\n\nEvaluation runs\n\nFor details about how to run an evaluation, see How to run an evaluation and view the results. Agent Evaluation supports two options for providing output from the chain:\n\nYou can run the application as part of the evaluation run. The application generates results for each input in the evaluation set.\n\nYou can provide output from a previous run of the application.\n\nFor details and explanation of when to use each option, see How to provide input to an evaluation run.\n\nGet human feedback about the quality of a GenAI application\n\nThe Databricks review app makes it easy to gather feedback about the quality of an AI application from human reviewers. For details, see Get feedback about the quality of an agentic application.\n\nGeo availability of Assistant features\n\nMosaic AI Agent Evaluation is a Designated Service that uses Geos to manage data residency when processing customer content. To learn more about the availability of Agent Evaluation in different geographic areas, see Databricks Designated Services.\n\nPricing\n\nFor pricing information, see Mosaic AI Agent Evaluation pricing.\n\nInformation about the models powering LLM judges\n\nLLM judges might use third-party services to evaluate your GenAI applications, including Azure OpenAI operated by Microsoft.\n\nFor Azure OpenAI, Databricks has opted out of Abuse Monitoring so no prompts or responses are stored with Azure OpenAI.\n\nFor European Union (EU) workspaces, LLM judges use models hosted in the EU. All other regions use models hosted in the US.\n\nDisabling Partner-powered AI assistive features prevents the LLM judge from calling Partner-powered models.\n\nData sent to the LLM judge is not used for any model training.\n\nLLM judges are intended to help customers evaluate their RAG applications, and LLM judge outputs should not be used to train, improve, or fine-tune an LLM.\n\n© Databricks 2025.

These models are designed to learn general patterns in language, images, or other data types, and can be fine-tuned for specific tasks with additional training.\n\nModel Serving offers flexible options for hosting and querying foundation models based on your needs:\n\nPay-per-token: Ideal for experimentation and quick exploration. This option allows you to query pre-configured endpoints in your Databricks workspace without upfront infrastructure commitments.\n\nProvisioned throughput: Recommended for production use cases requiring performance guarantees. This option enables the deployment of fine-tuned foundation models with optimized serving endpoints.\n\nExternal models: This option enables access to foundation models hosted outside of Databricks, such as those provided by OpenAI or Anthropic. These models can be centrally managed within Databricks for streamlined governance.\n\nFoundation models hosted on Databricks\n\nDatabricks hosts state-of-the-art open foundation models, like Meta Llama. These models are made available using Foundation Model APIs and are accessible using either pay-per-token or provisioned throughput.\n\nPay-per-token\n\nFoundation Model APIs pay-per-token is recommended for getting started and quick exploration. Each model that is supported using Foundation Model APIs pay-per-token has a preconfigured endpoint in your Databricks workspace that you can test and query. You can also interact and chat with these models using the AI Playground.\n\nThe following table summarizes the supported models for pay-per-token. See Foundation Model APIs limits for model specific region availability.\n\nImportant\n\nStarting December 11, 2024, Meta-Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct replaces support for Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct in Foundation Model APIs pay-per-token endpoints.\n\nThe following models are now retired.

You can create an endpoint that uses provisioned throughput to deploy fine-tuned foundation model architectures. When you use provisioned throughput the serving endpoint is optimized for foundation model workloads that require performance guarantees.\n\nThe following table summarizes the supported model architectures for provisioned throughput. Databricks recommends using the pretrained foundation models in Unity Catalog because these models are specifically optimized for provisioned throughput workloads.

These models are hosted outside of Databricks and you can create an endpoint to query them. These endpoints can be centrally governed from Databricks, which streamlines the use and management of various LLM providers within your organization.\n\nThe following table presents a non-exhaustive list of supported models and corresponding endpoint types.

It also provides details about supported model logging options and compute types, how to package model dependencies for serving, and endpoint creation and scaling.\n\nWhat are custom models?\n\nModel Serving can deploy any Python model as a production-grade API. Databricks refers to such models as custom models. These ML models can be trained using standard ML libraries like scikit-learn, XGBoost, PyTorch, and HuggingFace transformers and can include any Python code.\n\nTo deploy a custom model,\n\nLog the model or code in the MLflow format, using either native MLflow built-in flavors or pyfunc.\n\nAfter the model is logged, register it in the Unity Catalog (recommended) or the workspace registry.\n\nFrom here, you can create a model serving endpoint to deploy and query your model.\n\nSee Create custom model serving endpoints\n\nSee Query serving endpoints for custom models.\n\nFor a complete tutorial on how to serve custom models on Databricks, see Model serving tutorial.\n\nDatabricks also supports serving foundation models for generative AI applications, see Foundation Model APIs and External models for supported models and compute offerings.\n\nImportant\n\nIf you rely on Anaconda, review the terms of service notice for additional information.\n\nLog ML models\n\nThere are different methods to log your ML model for model serving. The following list summarizes the supported methods and examples.\n\nAutologging This method is automatically enabled when using Databricks Runtime for ML.\n\nCopy\nPython\nimport mlflow\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor\nfrom sklearn.datasets import load_iris\n\niris = load_iris()\nmodel = RandomForestRegressor()\nmodel.fit(iris.data, iris.target)\n\n\nLog using MLflow’s built-in flavors. You can use this method if you want to manually log the model for more detailed control.\n\nCopy\nPython\nimport mlflow\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier\nfrom sklearn.datasets import load_iris\n\niris = load_iris()\nmodel = RandomForestClassifier()\nmodel.fit(iris.data, iris.target)\n\nwith mlflow.start_run():\n    mlflow.sklearn.log_model(model, \"random_forest_classifier\")\n\n\nCustom logging with pyfunc. You can use this method for deploying arbitrary python code models or deploying additional code alongside your model.\n\nCopy\nPython\n  import mlflow\n  import mlflow.pyfunc\n\n  class Model(mlflow.pyfunc.PythonModel):\n      def predict(self, context, model_input):\n          return model_input * 2\n\n  with mlflow.start_run():\n      mlflow.pyfunc.log_model(\"custom_model\", python_model=Model())\n\n\nDownload from HuggingFace. You can download a model directly from Hugging Face and log that model for serving. For examples, see Notebook examples.\n\nSignature and input examples\n\nAdding a signature and input example to MLflow is recommended. Signatures are necessary for logging models to the Unity Catalog.\n\nThe following is a signature example:\n\nCopy\nPython\nfrom mlflow.models.signature import infer_signature\n\nsignature = infer_signature(training_data, model.predict(training_data))\nmlflow.sklearn.log_model(model, \"model\", signature=signature)\n\n\nThe following is an input example:\n\nCopy\nPython\n\ninput_example = {\"feature1\": 0.5, \"feature2\": 3}\nmlflow.sklearn.log_model(model, \"model\", input_example=input_example)\n\nCompute type\n\nMosaic AI Model Serving provides a variety of CPU and GPU options for deploying your model. When deploying with a GPU, you must make sure that your code is set up so that predictions are run on the GPU, using the methods provided by your framework. MLflow does this automatically for models logged with the PyTorch or Transformers flavors.\n\nWorkload type\n\n\t\n\nGPU instance\n\n\t\n\nMemory\n\n\n\n\nCPU\n\n\t\t\n\n4GB per concurrency\n\n\n\n\nGPU_SMALL\n\n\t\n\n1xT4\n\n\t\n\n16GB\n\n\n\n\nGPU_MEDIUM\n\n\t\n\n1xA10G\n\n\t\n\n24GB\n\n\n\n\nMULTIGPU_MEDIUM\n\n\t\n\n4xA10G\n\n\t\n\n96GB\n\n\n\n\nGPU_MEDIUM_8\n\n\t\n\n8xA10G\n\n\t\n\n192GB\n\nDeployment container and dependencies\n\nDuring deployment, a production-grade container is built and deployed as the endpoint. This container includes libraries automatically captured or specified in the MLflow model.\n\nThe model serving container doesn’t contain pre-installed dependencies, which might lead to dependency errors if not all required dependencies are included in the model. When running into model deployment issues, Databricks recommends you test the model locally.\n\nPackage and code dependencies\n\nCustom or private libraries can be added to your deployment. See Use custom Python libraries with Model Serving.\n\nFor MLflow native flavor models, the necessary package dependencies are automatically captured.\n\nFor custom pyfunc models, dependencies can be explicitly added.\n\nYou can add package dependencies using:\n\nThe pip_requirements parameter:\n\nCopy\nPython\nmlflow.sklearn.log_model(model, \"sklearn-model\", pip_requirements = [\"scikit-learn\", \"numpy\"])\n\n\nThe conda_env parameter:\n\nCopy\nPython\n\nconda_env = {\n    'channels': ['defaults'],\n    'dependencies': [\n        'python=3.7.0',\n        'scikit-learn=0.21.3'\n    ],\n    'name': 'mlflow-env'\n}\n\nmlflow.sklearn.log_model(model, \"sklearn-model\", conda_env = conda_env)\n\n\nTo include additional requirements beyond what is automatically captured, use extra_pip_requirements.\n\nCopy\nPython\nmlflow.sklearn.log_model(model, \"sklearn-model\", extra_pip_requirements = [\"sklearn_req\"])\n\n\nIf you have code dependencies, these can be specified using code_path.\n\nCopy\nPython\n  mlflow.sklearn.log_model(model, \"sklearn-model\", code_path=[\"path/to/helper_functions.py\"],)\n\nDependency validation\n\nPrior to deploying a custom MLflow model, it is beneficial to verify that the model is capable of being served. MLflow provides an API that allows for validation of the model artifact that both simulates the deployment environment and allows for testing of modified dependencies.\n\nThere are two pre-deployment validation APIs the MLflow Python API and the MLflow CLI.\n\nYou can specify the following using either of these APIs.\n\nThe model_uri of the model that is deployed to model serving.\n\nOne of the following:\n\nThe input_data in the expected format for the mlflow.pyfunc.PyFuncModel.predict() call of the model.\n\nThe input_path that defines a file containing input data that will be loaded and used for the call to predict.\n\nThe content_type in csv or json format.\n\nAn optional output_path to write the predictions to a file. If you omit this parameter, the predictions are printed to stdout.\n\nAn environment manager, env_manager, that is used to build the the environment for serving:\n\nThe default is virtualenv. Recommended for serving validation.\n\nlocal is available, but potentially error prone for serving validation. Generally used only for rapid debugging.\n\nWhether to install the current version of MLflow that is in your environment with the virtual environment using install_mlflow. This setting defaults to False.\n\nWhether to update and test different versions of package dependencies for troubleshooting or debugging. You can specify this as a list of string dependency overrides or additions using the override argument, pip_requirements_override.\n\nFor example:\n\nCopy\nPython\nimport mlflow\n\nrun_id = \"...\"\nmodel_uri = f\"runs:/{run_id}/model\"\n\nmlflow.models.predict(\n  model_uri=model_uri,\n  input_data={\"col1\": 34.2, \"col2\": 11.2, \"col3\": \"green\"},\n  content_type=\"json\",\n  env_manager=\"virtualenv\",\n  install_mlflow=False,\n  pip_requirements_override=[\"pillow==10.3.0\", \"scipy==1.13.0\"],\n)\n\nDependency updates\n\nIf there are any issues with the dependencies specified with a logged model, you can update the requirements by using the MLflow CLI or mlflow.models.model.update_model_requirements() in th MLflow Python API without having to log another model.\n\nThe following example shows how update the pip_requirements.txt of a logged model in-place.\n\nYou can update existing definitions with specified package versions or add non-existent requirements to the pip_requirements.txt file. This file is within the MLflow model artifact at the specified model_uri location.\n\nCopy\nPython\nfrom mlflow.models.model import update_model_requirements\n\nupdate_model_requirements(\n  model_uri=model_uri,\n  operation=\"add\",\n  requirement_list=[\"pillow==10.2.0\", \"scipy==1.12.0\"],\n)\n\nExpectations and limitations\n\nThe following sections describe known expectations and limitations for serving custom models using Model Serving.\n\nEndpoint creation and update expectations\n\nNote\n\nThe information in this section does not apply to endpoints that serve foundation models or external models.\n\nDeploying a newly registered model version involves packaging the model and its model environment and provisioning the model endpoint itself. This process can take approximately 10 minutes.\n\nDatabricks performs a zero-downtime update of endpoints by keeping the existing endpoint configuration up until the new one becomes ready. Doing so reduces risk of interruption for endpoints that are in use.\n\nIf model computation takes longer than 120 seconds, requests will time out. If you believe your model computation will take longer than 120 seconds, reach out to your Databricks account team.\n\nDatabricks performs occasional zero-downtime system updates and maintenance on existing Model Serving endpoints. During maintenance, Databricks reloads models and marks an endpoint as Failed if a model fails to reload. Make sure your customized models are robust and are able to reload at any time.\n\nEndpoint scaling expectations\n\nNote\n\nThe information in this section does not apply to endpoints that serve foundation models or external models.\n\nServing endpoints automatically scale based on traffic and the capacity of provisioned concurrency units.\n\nProvisioned concurrency: The maximum number of parallel requests the system can handle. Estimate the required concurrency using the formula: provisioned concurrency = queries per second (QPS) * model execution time (s).\n\nScaling behavior: Endpoints scale up almost immediately with increased traffic and scale down every five minutes to match reduced traffic.\n\nScale to zero: Endpoints can scale down to zero after 30 minutes of inactivity. The first request after scaling to zero experiences a “cold start,” leading to higher latency. For latency-sensitive applications, consider strategies to manage this feature effectively.\n\nGPU workload limitations\n\nThe following are limitations for serving endpoints with GPU workloads:\n\nContainer image creation for GPU serving takes longer than image creation for CPU serving due to model size and increased installation requirements for models served on GPU.\n\nWhen deploying very large models, the deployment process might timeout if the container build and model deployment exceed a 60-minute duration. Should this occur, initiate a retry of the process. A retry should successfully deploy the model.\n\nAutoscaling for GPU serving takes longer than for CPU serving.\n\nGPU capacity is not guaranteed when scaling to zero. GPU endpoints might expect extra high latency for the first request after scaling to zero.\n\nThis functionality is not available in ap-southeast-1.\n\nAnaconda licensing update\n\nThe following notice is for customers relying on Anaconda.\n\nImportant\n\nAnaconda Inc. updated their terms of service for anaconda.org channels. Based on the new terms of service you may require a commercial license if you rely on Anaconda’s packaging and distribution. See Anaconda Commercial Edition FAQ for more information. Your use of any Anaconda channels is governed by their terms of service.\n\nMLflow models logged before v1.18 (Databricks Runtime 8.3 ML or earlier) were by default logged with the conda defaults channel (https://repo.anaconda.com/pkgs/) as a dependency. Because of this license change, Databricks has stopped the use of the defaults channel for models logged using MLflow v1.18 and above. The default channel logged is now conda-forge, which points at the community managed https://conda-forge.org/.\n\nIf you logged a model before MLflow v1.18 without excluding the defaults channel from the conda environment for the model, that model may have a dependency on the defaults channel that you may not have intended. To manually confirm whether a model has this dependency, you can examine channel value in the conda.yaml file that is packaged with the logged model. For example, a model’s conda.yaml with a defaults channel dependency may look like this:\n\nCopy\nYAML\nchannels:\n- defaults\ndependencies:\n- python=3.8.8\n- pip\n- pip:\n    - mlflow\n    - scikit-learn==0.23.2\n    - cloudpickle==1.6.0\n      name: mlflow-env\n\n\nBecause Databricks can not determine whether your use of the Anaconda repository to interact with your models is permitted under your relationship with Anaconda, Databricks is not forcing its customers to make any changes. If your use of the Anaconda.com repo through the use of Databricks is permitted under Anaconda’s terms, you do not need to take any action.\n\nIf you would like to change the channel used in a model’s environment, you can re-register the model to the model registry with a new conda.yaml. You can do this by specifying the channel in the conda_env parameter of log_model().\n\nFor more information on the log_model() API, see the MLflow documentation for the model flavor you are working with, for example, log_model for scikit-learn.\n\nFor more information on conda.yaml files, see the MLflow documentation.\n\nAdditional resources\nCreate custom model serving endpoints\nQuery serving endpoints for custom models\nDebugging guide for Model Serving\nUse custom Python libraries with Model Serving\nPackage custom artifacts for Model Serving\nDeploy Python code with Model Serving\nConfigure route optimization on serving endpoints\nConfigure access to resources from model serving endpoints\nAdd an instance profile to a model serving endpoint\n\n© Databricks 2025.

See Serving endpoints in the REST API reference.\n\nTo create model serving endpoints use one of the following:\n\nCreate custom model serving endpoints.\n\nCreate foundation model serving endpoints.\n\nGet the status of the model endpoint\n\nIn the Serving UI, you can check the status of an endpoint from the Serving endpoint state indicator at the top of your endpoint’s details page.\n\nCheck the status and details of an endpoint programmatically using the REST API or the MLflow Deployments SDK:\n\nREST API\nMLflow Deployments SDK\nCopy\nGET /api/2.0/serving-endpoints/{name}\n\n\nThe following example creates an endpoint that serves the first version of the my-ads-model model that is registered in the Unity Catalog model registry. You must provide the full model name including parent catalog and schema such as, catalog.schema.example-model.\n\nIn the following example response, the state.ready field is “READY”, which means the endpoint is ready to receive traffic. The state.update_state field is NOT_UPDATING and pending_config is no longer returned because the update was finished successfully.\n\nCopy\n{\n  \"name\": \"unity-model-endpoint\",\n  \"creator\": \"customer@example.com\",\n  \"creation_timestamp\": 1666829055000,\n  \"last_updated_timestamp\": 1666829055000,\n  \"state\": {\n    \"ready\": \"READY\",\n    \"update_state\": \"NOT_UPDATING\"\n  },\n  \"config\": {\n    \"served_entities\": [\n      {\n        \"name\": \"my-ads-model\",\n        \"entity_name\": \"myCatalog.mySchema.my-ads-model\",\n        \"entity_version\": \"1\",\n        \"workload_size\": \"Small\",\n        \"scale_to_zero_enabled\": false,\n        \"state\": {\n          \"deployment\": \"DEPLOYMENT_READY\",\n          \"deployment_state_message\": \"\"\n        },\n        \"creator\": \"customer@example.com\",\n        \"creation_timestamp\": 1666829055000\n      }\n    ],\n    \"traffic_config\": {\n      \"routes\": [\n        {\n          \"served_model_name\": \"my-ads-model\",\n          \"traffic_percentage\": 100\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    \"config_version\": 1\n  },\n  \"id\": \"xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\",\n  \"permission_level\": \"CAN_MANAGE\"\n}\n\nStop a model serving endpoint\n\nYou can temporarily stop a model serving endpoint and start it later. When an endpoint is stopped, the resources provisioned for it are shut down, and the endpoint is not able to serve queries until it is started again. Only endpoints that serve custom models, are not route-optimized, and have no in-progress updates can be stopped. Stopped endpoints do not count against the resource quota. Queries sent to a stopped endpoint return a 400 error.\n\nYou can stop an endpoint from the endpoint’s details page in the Serving UI.\n\nClick the endpoint you want to stop.\n\nClick Stop in the upper-right corner.\n\nAlternatively, you can stop a serving endpoint programmatically using the REST API as follows:\n\nCopy\nBash\nPOST /api/2.0/serving-endpoints/{name}/config:stop\n\n\nWhen you are ready to start a stopped model serving endpoint, you can do so from the endpoint’s details page in the Serving UI.\n\nClick the endpoint you want to start.\n\nClick Start in the upper-right corner.\n\nAlternatively, you can start a stopped serving endpoint programmatically using the REST API as follows:\n\nCopy\nBash\nPOST /api/2.0/serving-endpoints/{name}/config:start\n\nDelete a model serving endpoint\n\nTo disable serving for a model, you can delete the endpoint it’s served on.\n\nYou can delete an endpoint from the endpoint’s details page in the Serving UI.\n\nClick Serving on the sidebar.\n\nClick the endpoint you want to delete.\n\nClick the kebab menu at the top and select Delete.\n\nAlternatively, you can delete a serving endpoint programmatically using the REST API or the MLflow Deployments SDK\n\nREST API\nMLflow Deployments SDK\nCopy\nDELETE /api/2.0/serving-endpoints/{name}\n\nDebug your model serving endpoint\n\nTo debug any issues with the endpoint, you can fetch:\n\nModel server container build logs\n\nModel server logs\n\nThese logs are also accessible from the Endpoints UI in the Logs tab.\n\nFor the build logs for a served model you can use the following request. See Debugging guide for Model Serving for more information.\n\nCopy\nBash\nGET /api/2.0/serving-endpoints/{name}/served-models/{served-model-name}/build-logs\n{\n  “config_version”: 1  // optional\n}\n\n\nFor the model server logs for a serve model, you can use the following request:\n\nCopy\nBash\nGET /api/2.0/serving-endpoints/{name}/served-models/{served-model-name}/logs\n\n{\n  “config_version”: 1  // optional\n}\n\nManage permissions on your model serving endpoint\n\nYou must have at least the CAN MANAGE permission on a serving endpoint to modify permissions. For more information on the permission levels, see Serving endpoint ACLs.\n\nGet the list of permissions on the serving endpoint.\n\nCopy\nBash\ndatabricks permissions get servingendpoints <endpoint-id>\n\n\nGrant user jsmith@example.com the CAN QUERY permission on the serving endpoint.\n\nCopy\nBash\ndatabricks permissions update servingendpoints <endpoint-id> --json '{\n  \"access_control_list\": [\n    {\n      \"user_name\": \"jsmith@example.com\",\n      \"permission_level\": \"CAN_QUERY\"\n    }\n  ]\n}'\n\n\nYou can also modify serving endpoint permissions using the Permissions API.\n\nAdd a budget policy for a model serving endpoint\n\nPreview\n\nThis feature is in Public Preview and is not available for serving endpoints that serve External models or Foundation Model APIs pay-per-token workloads.\n\nBudget policies allow your organization to apply custom tags on serverless usage for granular billing attribution. If your workspace uses budget policies to attribute serverless usage, you can add a budget policy to your model serving endpoints. See Attribute serverless usage with budget policies.\n\nDuring model serving endpoint creation, you can select your endpoint’s budget policy from the Budget policy menu in the Serving UI. If you have a budget policy assigned to you, all endpoints that you create are assigned that budget policy, even if you do not select a policy from the Budget policy menu.\n\nIf you have MANAGE permissions for an existing endpoint, you can edit and add a budget policy to that endpoint from the Endpoint details page in the UI.\n\nNote\n\nIf you’ve been assigned a budget policy, your existing endpoints are not automatically tagged with your policy. You must manually update existing endpoints if you want to attach a budget policy to them.\n\nGet a model serving endpoint schema\n\nPreview\n\nSupport for serving endpoint query schemas is in Public Preview. This functionality is available in Model Serving regions.\n\nA serving endpoint query schema is a formal description of the serving endpoint using the standard OpenAPI specification in JSON format. It contains information about the endpoint including the endpoint path, details for querying the endpoint like the request and response body format, and data type for each field. This information can be helpful for reproducibility scenarios or when you need information about the endpoint, but you are not the original endpoint creator or owner.\n\nTo get the model serving endpoint schema, the served model must have a model signature logged and the endpoint must be in a READY state.\n\nThe following examples demonstrate how to programmatically get the model serving endpoint schema using the REST API. For feature serving endpoint schemas, see What is Databricks Feature Serving?.\n\nThe schema returned by the API is in the format of a JSON object that follows the OpenAPI specification.\n\nCopy\nBash\nACCESS_TOKEN=\"<endpoint-token>\"\nENDPOINT_NAME=\"<endpoint name>\"\n\ncurl \"https://example.databricks.com/api/2.0/serving-endpoints/$ENDPOINT_NAME/openapi\" -H \"Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN\" -H \"Content-Type: application/json\"\n\n\nSchema response details\n\nThe response is an OpenAPI specification in JSON format, typically including fields like openapi, info, servers and paths. Since the schema response is a JSON object, you can parse it using common programming languages, and generate client code from the specification using third-party tools. You can also visualize the OpenAPI specification using third-party tools like Swagger Editor.\n\nThe main fields of the response include:\n\nThe info.title field shows the name of the serving endpoint.\n\nThe servers field always contains one object, typically the url field which is the base url of the endpoint.\n\nThe paths object in the response contains all supported paths for an endpoint. The keys in the object are the path URL. Each path can support multiple formats of inputs. These inputs are listed in the oneOf field.\n\nThe following is an example endpoint schema response:\n\nCopy\nJSON\n{\n  \"openapi\": \"3.1.0\",\n  \"info\": {\n    \"title\": \"example-endpoint\",\n

Each model you serve is available as a REST API that you can integrate into your web or client application.\n\nModel Serving provides a highly available and low-latency service for deploying models. The service automatically scales up or down to meet demand changes, saving infrastructure costs while optimizing latency performance. This functionality uses serverless compute. See the Model Serving pricing page for more details.\n\nModel Serving offers a unified REST API and MLflow Deployment API for CRUD and querying tasks. In addition, it provides a single UI to manage all your models and their respective serving endpoints. You can also access models directly from SQL using AI functions for easy integration into analytics workflows.\n\nSee the following guides to get started:\n\nFor an introductory tutorial on how to serve custom models on Databricks, see Tutorial: Deploy and query a custom model.\n\nFor a getting started tutorial on how to query a foundation model on Databricks, see Get started querying LLMs on Databricks.\n\nFor performing batch inference, see Deploy models for batch inference and prediction.\n\nModels you can deploy\n\nModel serving supports real time and batch inference for the following model types:\n\nCustom models. These are Python models packaged in the MLflow format. They can be registered either in Unity Catalog or in the workspace model registry. Examples include scikit-learn, XGBoost, PyTorch, and Hugging Face transformer models.\n\nAgent serving is supported as a custom model. See Deploy an agent for generative AI application\n\nFoundation models.\n\nDatabricks-hosted foundation models like Meta Llama. These models are available using Foundation Model APIs. These models are curated foundation model architectures that support optimized inference. Base models, like Meta-Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct, GTE-Large, and Mistral-7B are available for immediate use with pay-per-token pricing, and workloads that require performance guarantees and fine-tuned model variants can be deployed with provisioned throughput.\n\nFoundation models hosted outside of Databricks like GPT-4 from OpenAI. These models are accessible using External models. The endpoints that serve these models can be centrally governed from Databricks, so you can streamline the use and management of various LLM providers, such as OpenAI and Anthropic, within your organization.\n\nNote\n\nYou can interact with supported large language models using the AI Playground. The AI Playground is a chat-like environment where you can test, prompt, and compare LLMs. This functionality is available in your Databricks workspace.\n\nWhy use Model Serving?\n\nDeploy and query any models: Model Serving provides a unified interface that so you can manage all models in one location and query them with a single API, regardless of whether they are hosted on Databricks or externally. This approach simplifies the process of experimenting with, customizing, and deploying models in production across various clouds and providers.\n\nSecurely customize models with your private data: Built on a Data Intelligence Platform, Model Serving simplifies the integration of features and embeddings into models through native integration with the Databricks Feature Store and Mosaic AI Vector Search. For even more improved accuracy and contextual understanding, models can be fine-tuned with proprietary data and deployed effortlessly on Model Serving.\n\nGovern and monitor models: The Serving UI allows you to centrally manage all model endpoints in one place, including those that are externally hosted. You can manage permissions, track and set usage limits and monitor the quality of all types of models using AI Gateway. This enables you to democratize access to SaaS and open LLMs within your organization while ensuring appropriate guardrails are in place.\n\nReduce cost with optimized inference and fast scaling: Databricks has implemented a range of optimizations to ensure you get the best throughput and latency for large models. The endpoints automatically scale up or down to meet demand changes, saving infrastructure costs while optimizing latency performance. Monitor model serving costs.\n\nNote\n\nFor workloads that are latency sensitive or involve a high number of queries per second, Databricks recommends using route optimization on custom model serving endpoints. Reach out to your Databricks account team to ensure your workspace is enabled for high scalability.\n\nBring reliability and security to Model Serving: Model Serving is designed for high-availability, low-latency production use and can support over 25K queries per second with an overhead latency of less than 50 ms. The serving workloads are protected by multiple layers of security, ensuring a secure and reliable environment for even the most sensitive tasks.\n\nNote\n\nModel Serving does not provide security patches to existing model images because of the risk of destabilization to production deployments. A new model image created from a new model version will contain the latest patches. Reach out to your Databricks account team for more information.\n\nRequirements\n\nRegistered model in Unity Catalog or the Workspace Model Registry.\n\nPermissions on the registered models as described in Serving endpoint ACLs.\n\nMLflow 1.29 or higher.\n\nEnable Model Serving for your workspace\n\nTo use Model Serving, your account admin must read and accept the terms and conditions for enabling serverless compute in the account console.\n\nNote\n\nIf your account was created after March 28, 2022, serverless compute is enabled by default for your workspaces.\n\nIf you are not an account admin, you cannot perform these steps. Contact an account admin if your workspace needs access to serverless compute.\n\nAs an account admin, go to the feature enablement tab of the account console settings page.\n\nA banner at the top of the page prompts you to accept the additional terms. Once you read the terms, click Accept. If you do not see the banner asking you to accept the terms, this step has been completed already.\n\nAfter you’ve accepted the terms, your account is enabled for serverless.\n\nNo additional steps are required to enable Model Serving in your workspace.\n\nLimitations and region availability\n\nMosaic AI Model Serving imposes default limits to ensure reliable performance. See Model Serving limits and regions.

It is a centralized service that brings governance, monitoring, and production readiness to model serving endpoints. It also allows you to run, secure, and govern AI traffic to democratize and accelerate AI adoption for your organization.\n\nAll data is logged into Delta tables in Unity Catalog.\n\nTo start visualizing insights from your AI Gateway data, download the example AI Gateway dashboard from GitHub. This dashboard leverages the data from the usage tracking and payload logging inference tables.\n\nAfter you download the JSON file, import the dashboard into your workspace. For instructions on importing dashboards, see Import a dashboard file.\n\nSupported features\n\nThe following table defines the available AI Gateway features and which model serving endpoint types support them.\n\nFeature\n\n\t\n\nDefinition\n\n\t\n\nExternal model endpoint\n\n\t\n\nFoundation Model APIs provisioned throughput endpoint\n\n\n\n\nPermission and rate limiting\n\n\t\n\nControl who has access and how much access.\n\n\t\n\n✓\n\n\t\n\n✓\n\n\n\n\nPayload logging\n\n\t\n\nMonitor and audit data being sent to model APIs using inference tables.\n\n\t\n\n✓\n\n\t\n\n✓\n\n\n\n\nUsage tracking\n\n\t\n\nMonitor operational usage on endpoints and associated costs using system tables.\n\n\t\n\n✓\n\n\t\n\n✓\n\n\n\n\nAI Guardrails\n\n\t\n\nPrevent unwanted data and unsafe data in requests and responses. See AI Guardrails.\n\n\t\n\n✓\n\n\t\n\n✓\n\n\n\n\nTraffic routing\n\n\t\n\nMinimize production outages during and after deployment.\n\n\t\n\n✓\n\n\t\n\n✓\n\nMosaic AI Gateway incurs charges on an enabled feature basis. During preview these paid features include AI Guardrails, payload logging and usage tracking. Features such as query permissions, rate limiting, and traffic routing are free of charge. Any new features are subject to charge.\n\nAI Guardrails\n\nAI Guardrails allow users to configure and enforce data compliance at the model serving endpoint level and to reduce harmful content on any requests sent to the underlying model. Bad requests and responses are blocked and a default message is returned to the user. See how to configure guardrails on a model serving endpoint.\n\nImportant\n\nAI Guardrails are only available in regions that support Foundation Model APIs pay-per-token.\n\nThe following table summarizes the configurable guardrails. See Limitations.\n\nGuardrail\n\n\t\n\nDefinition\n\n\n\n\nSafety filtering\n\n\t\n\nSafety filtering prevents your model from interacting with unsafe and harmful content, like violent crime, self-harm, and hate speech.\n\nAI Gateway safety filter is built with Meta Llama 3. Databricks uses Llama Guard 2-8b as the safety filter. To learn more about the Llama Guard safety filter and what topics apply to the safety filter, see the Meta Llama Guard 2 8B model card.\n\nMeta Llama 3 is licensed under the LLAMA 3 Community License, Copyright © Meta Platforms, Inc. All Rights Reserved. Customers are responsible for ensuring compliance with applicable model licenses.\n\n\n\n\nPersonally identifiable information (PII) detection\n\n\t\n\nCustomers can detect any sensitive information such as names, addresses, credit card numbers for users.\n\nFor this feature, AI Gateway uses Presidio to detect the following U.S. categories of PII: credit card numbers, email addresses, phone numbers, bank account numbers, and social security numbers.\n\nThe PII classifier can help identify sensitive information or PII in structured and unstructured data. However, because it is using automated detection mechanisms, there is no guarantee that the service will find all sensitive information. Consequently, additional systems and protections should be employed.\n\nThese classification methods are primarily scoped to U.S. categories of PII, such as U.S. phone numbers, and social security numbers.\n\n\n\n\nTopic moderation\n\n\t\n\nCapability to list a set of allowed topics. Given a chat request, this guardrail flags the request if its topic is not in the allowed topics.\n\n\n\n\nKeyword filtering\n\n\t\n\nCustomers can specify different sets of invalid keywords for both the input and the output. One potential use case for keyword filtering is so the model does not talk about competitors.\n\nThis guardrail uses keyword or string matching to decide if the keyword exists in the request or response content.\n\nUse AI Gateway\n\nYou can configure AI Gateway features on your model serving endpoints using the Serving UI. See Configure AI Gateway on model serving endpoints.\n\nLimitations\n\nThe following are limitations during the preview:\n\nAI Gateway is only supported for:\n\nFoundation Model APIs provisioned throughput model serving endpoints.\n\nModel serving endpoints that serve external models.\n\nWhen AI guardrails are used, the request batch size, that is an embeddings batch size, completions batch size, or the n parameter of chat requests, can not exceed 16.\n\nFor provisioned throughput workloads, only rate limiting and payload logging using AI Gateway-enabled inference tables are supported.\n\nSee AI Gateway-enabled inference table limitations.\n\nIf you use function calling and specify AI guardrails, those guardrails are not applied to the requests and intermediate responses of the function. However, guardrails are applied to the final output response.\n\n© Databricks 2025. All rights reserved.

Each model you serve is available as a REST API that you can integrate into your web or client application.\n\nModel Serving provides a highly available and low-latency service for deploying models. The service automatically scales up or down to meet demand changes, saving infrastructure costs while optimizing latency performance. This functionality uses serverless compute. See the Model Serving pricing page for more details.\n\nModel Serving offers a unified REST API and MLflow Deployment API for CRUD and querying tasks. In addition, it provides a single UI to manage all your models and their respective serving endpoints. You can also access models directly from SQL using AI functions for easy integration into analytics workflows.\n\nSee the following guides to get started:\n\nFor an introductory tutorial on how to serve custom models on Databricks, see Tutorial: Deploy and query a custom model.\n\nFor a getting started tutorial on how to query a foundation model on Databricks, see Get started querying LLMs on Databricks.\n\nFor performing batch inference, see Deploy models for batch inference and prediction.\n\nModels you can deploy\n\nModel serving supports real time and batch inference for the following model types:\n\nCustom models. These are Python models packaged in the MLflow format. They can be registered either in Unity Catalog or in the workspace model registry. Examples include scikit-learn, XGBoost, PyTorch, and Hugging Face transformer models.\n\nAgent serving is supported as a custom model. See Deploy an agent for generative AI application\n\nFoundation models.\n\nDatabricks-hosted foundation models like Meta Llama. These models are available using Foundation Model APIs. These models are curated foundation model architectures that support optimized inference. Base models, like Meta-Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct, GTE-Large, and Mistral-7B are available for immediate use with pay-per-token pricing, and workloads that require performance guarantees and fine-tuned model variants can be deployed with provisioned throughput.\n\nFoundation models hosted outside of Databricks like GPT-4 from OpenAI. These models are accessible using External models. The endpoints that serve these models can be centrally governed from Databricks, so you can streamline the use and management of various LLM providers, such as OpenAI and Anthropic, within your organization.\n\nNote\n\nYou can interact with supported large language models using the AI Playground. The AI Playground is a chat-like environment where you can test, prompt, and compare LLMs. This functionality is available in your Databricks workspace.\n\nWhy use Model Serving?\n\nDeploy and query any models: Model Serving provides a unified interface that so you can manage all models in one location and query them with a single API, regardless of whether they are hosted on Databricks or externally. This approach simplifies the process of experimenting with, customizing, and deploying models in production across various clouds and providers.\n\nSecurely customize models with your private data: Built on a Data Intelligence Platform, Model Serving simplifies the integration of features and embeddings into models through native integration with the Databricks Feature Store and Mosaic AI Vector Search. For even more improved accuracy and contextual understanding, models can be fine-tuned with proprietary data and deployed effortlessly on Model Serving.\n\nGovern and monitor models: The Serving UI allows you to centrally manage all model endpoints in one place, including those that are externally hosted. You can manage permissions, track and set usage limits and monitor the quality of all types of models using AI Gateway. This enables you to democratize access to SaaS and open LLMs within your organization while ensuring appropriate guardrails are in place.\n\nReduce cost with optimized inference and fast scaling: Databricks has implemented a range of optimizations to ensure you get the best throughput and latency for large models. The endpoints automatically scale up or down to meet demand changes, saving infrastructure costs while optimizing latency performance. Monitor model serving costs.\n\nNote\n\nFor workloads that are latency sensitive or involve a high number of queries per second, Databricks recommends using route optimization on custom model serving endpoints. Reach out to your Databricks account team to ensure your workspace is enabled for high scalability.\n\nBring reliability and security to Model Serving: Model Serving is designed for high-availability, low-latency production use and can support over 25K queries per second with an overhead latency of less than 50 ms. The serving workloads are protected by multiple layers of security, ensuring a secure and reliable environment for even the most sensitive tasks.\n\nNote\n\nModel Serving does not provide security patches to existing model images because of the risk of destabilization to production deployments. A new model image created from a new model version will contain the latest patches. Reach out to your Databricks account team for more information.\n\nRequirements\n\nRegistered model in Unity Catalog or the Workspace Model Registry.\n\nPermissions on the registered models as described in Serving endpoint ACLs.\n\nMLflow 1.29 or higher.\n\nEnable Model Serving for your workspace\n\nTo use Model Serving, your account admin must read and accept the terms and conditions for enabling serverless compute in the account console.\n\nNote\n\nIf your account was created after March 28, 2022, serverless compute is enabled by default for your workspaces.\n\nIf you are not an account admin, you cannot perform these steps. Contact an account admin if your workspace needs access to serverless compute.\n\nAs an account admin, go to the feature enablement tab of the account console settings page.\n\nA banner at the top of the page prompts you to accept the additional terms. Once you read the terms, click Accept. If you do not see the banner asking you to accept the terms, this step has been completed already.\n\nAfter you’ve accepted the terms, your account is enabled for serverless.\n\nNo additional steps are required to enable Model Serving in your workspace.\n\nLimitations and region availability\n\nMosaic AI Model Serving imposes default limits to ensure reliable performance. See Model Serving limits and regions. If you have feedback on these limits or an endpoint in an unsupported region, reach out to your Databricks account team.\n\nData protection in Model Serving\n\nDatabricks takes data security seriously. Databricks understands the importance of the data you analyze using Mosaic AI Model Serving, and implements the following security controls to protect your data.\n\nEvery customer request to Model Serving is logically isolated, authenticated, and authorized.\n\nMosaic AI Model Serving encrypts all data at rest (AES-256) and in transit (TLS 1.2+).\n\nFor all paid accounts, Mosaic AI Model Serving does not use user inputs submitted to the service or outputs from the service to train any models or improve any Databricks services.\n\nFor Databricks Foundation Model APIs, as part of providing the service, Databricks may temporarily process and store inputs and outputs for the purposes of preventing, detecting, and mitigating abuse or harmful uses. Your inputs and outputs are isolated from those of other customers, stored in the same region as your workspace for up to thirty (30) days, and only accessible for detecting and responding to security or abuse concerns.
